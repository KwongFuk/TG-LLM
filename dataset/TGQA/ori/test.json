[{"story": "Once upon a time in the small town of Bristol, Connecticut, two extraordinary individuals were born in the same year of 1948 - Chris Evans and Oliver Jensen. Little did they know that their paths would intertwine in ways they would never have imagined.\n\nAs they grew older, Chris and Oliver led separate lives, each facing their own trials and triumphs. However, fate had plans for their union, and in 1970, their lives came crashing together when they crossed paths and instantly felt a deep connection. Their love blossomed, and they decided to embark on a journey together as a married couple.\n\nChris, a visionary entrepreneur, founded the Pearl Network, a telecommunications company, in 2005. With his innovative ideas and determination, he steered the company towards great success, making it a pioneer in its industry. At the same time, Chris was also recognized for his remarkable achievements and was honored with the prestigious Victory Achievement Award in 2007.\n\nDespite their success professionally, their relationship faced its share of challenges. By 2010, Chris and Oliver made the difficult decision to end their marriage, realizing that their paths had diverged too far apart. Although their love for each other remained, they knew that it was time to move on and find happiness in different ways.\n\nThe Pearl Network thrived under Chris's leadership, but in 2013, he decided it was time for a new chapter in his life. He gracefully stepped down from his position, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and success that would be remembered by many.\n\nAs time went on, Chris and Oliver found solace and happiness in their separate lives. They both reflected on the beautiful memories they had shared together and the growth they had experienced during their time as a couple.\n\nTheir story serves as a reminder that sometimes, love cannot withstand the tests of time, but it doesn't diminish the impact they had on each other's lives. Chris and Oliver will forever be tied by their shared past, and as they continue to live separate lives, they remain eternally grateful for the love they once shared and the lessons they learned along the way.", "TG": "(Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut) starts at 1948\n(Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut) starts at 1948\n(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) starts at 1970\n(Oliver Jensen was married to Chris Evans) starts at 1970\n(Chris Evans owned Pearl Network) starts at 2005\n(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award) starts at 2007\n(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) ends at 2010\n(Oliver Jensen was married to Chris Evans) ends at 2010\n(Chris Evans owned Pearl Network) ends at 2013\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) or (Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen)", "(Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award) or (Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)", "(Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Jensen was married to Chris Evans) or (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)?", "C": ["(Oliver Jensen was married to Chris Evans)", "(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) or (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen)", "(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) or (Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen)", "(Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen) or (Chris Evans owned Pearl Network)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen)", "(Chris Evans owned Pearl Network)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Evans owned Pearl Network) or (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)?", "C": ["(Chris Evans owned Pearl Network)", "(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut) or (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)?", "C": ["(Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut)", "(Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut) or (Chris Evans owned Pearl Network)?", "C": ["(Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut)", "(Chris Evans owned Pearl Network)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Chris Evans won prize Victory Achievement Award), (Chris Evans owned Pearl Network), (Chris Evans was born in Bristol, Connecticut), (Chris Evans was married to Oliver Jensen), (Oliver Jensen was born in Bristol, Connecticut).

From a young age, his passion for sports was evident. As he grew older, he became a notable figure in the world of football.\n\nIn 1993, at the age of ten, Paul joined the prestigious Northern Rovers F.C. His remarkable skills on the field quickly caught the attention of many. However, his time with the team was short-lived, as he left in 1995. Seeking new opportunities, Paul signed with the Blazing Tigers in Hartford.\n\nFor a brief period, Paul showcased his talent with the Blazing Tigers, captivating fans with his agility and technique. Nonetheless, in 2001, he decided to make a change and joined the Los Angeles Tigers football team. This move allowed Paul to experience the vibrant football scene and embrace the competitive spirit of Los Angeles.\n\nBut Paul's thirst for new challenges was far from satisfied. In the same year, he headed across the Atlantic and joined the London Sporting Club. His elegant style of play and scoring prowess made him a beloved member of the team. Unfortunately, his time in London came to an end in 2003.\n\nDuring this period of transition, Paul discovered a hidden talent. In 2003, he briefly ventured into basketball, playing for the Denver national under-20 basketball team. Although it wasn't a long-term endeavor, this experience allowed him to explore his athletic versatility.\n\nIn search of a familiar environment, Paul returned to his football career and joined Brighton United C in 2003. His exceptional performance on the field continued to impress fans and coaches alike. However, in 2004, he decided to explore new horizons once again and joined the Ocean City Football Club.\n\nPaul's time with Ocean City was brief, as he left in the same year. But he didn't remain idle for long. In 2005, he found himself playing for Oliverstown United. This team provided him with a fresh start and a chance to regain his footing in the football world. Paul's time with Oliverstown United lasted until 2007, during which he made a lasting impact on his teammates and supporters.\n\nAfter a few years away from professional sports, Paul rekindled his passion for the game in 2011. He joined Greenfield United in Chicago, where he continued to make headlines with his exceptional skills. Having found his stride once more, Paul's time with Greenfield United lasted until 2013, solidifying his reputation as a remarkable athlete.\n\nThroughout his journey, Paul Anderson's relentless pursuit of new experiences and challenges led him to leave an indelible mark on the world of sport. His unwavering dedication, natural talent, and versatility earned him a place among the greats, forever remembered as a figure who pushed the boundaries of what it meant to be an athlete.", "TG": "(Paul Anderson was born in Austin) starts at 1983\n(Paul Anderson played for Northern Rovers F.C.) starts at 1993\n(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford)) starts at 1995\n(Paul Anderson played for Northern Rovers F.C.) ends at 1995\n(Paul Anderson played for Los Angeles Tigers football team) starts at 2001\n(Paul Anderson played for London Sporting Club) starts at 2001\n(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford)) ends at 2001\n(Paul Anderson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) starts at 2003\n(Paul Anderson played for London Sporting Club) ends at 2003\n(Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C) starts at 2003\n(Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club) starts at 2004\n(Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C) ends at 2004\n(Paul Anderson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) ends at 2004\n(Paul Anderson played for Oliverstown United) starts at 2005\n(Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club) ends at 2005\n(Paul Anderson played for Oliverstown United) ends at 2007\n(Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)) starts at 2011\n(Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)) ends at 2013\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C) or (Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C)", "(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)) or (Paul Anderson played for Oliverstown United)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago))", "(Paul Anderson played for Oliverstown United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)) or (Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago))", "(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)) or (Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago))", "(Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C) or (Paul Anderson played for Northern Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C)", "(Paul Anderson played for Northern Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C) or (Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C)", "(Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford)) or (Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))", "(Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) or (Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team)", "(Paul Anderson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford))"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Paul Anderson played for Los Angeles Tigers football team) or (Paul Anderson was born in Austin)?", "C": ["(Paul Anderson played for Los Angeles Tigers football team)", "(Paul Anderson was born in Austin)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Paul Anderson played for Brighton United C), (Paul Anderson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team), (Paul Anderson played for Ocean City Football Club), (Paul Anderson played for Los Angeles Tigers football team), (Paul Anderson played for Greenfield United (Chicago)).

talented footballer, was born in the vibrant city of Austin in 1985. From a young age, he displayed a natural talent for the sport, captivating both his friends and family with his skills on the field.\n\nAs Harry grew older, his passion and dedication to football only intensified. In 2002, he joined Redwood City FC, a prestigious club known for nurturing young talent. Harry's time with Redwood City FC proved to be a pivotal moment in his career, as he honed his abilities and gained valuable experience playing at a competitive level.\n\nAfter two fruitful years with Redwood City FC, Harry decided to explore new opportunities and challenges. In 2004, he bid farewell to the club and set his sights on joining the Greenland national under-21 football team. It was an incredible accomplishment for him, representing his country and showcasing his skills on an international stage.\n\nHowever, Harry's hunger for growth and development as a player led him to embark on a new chapter in his career. In 2006, he joined Skye United F.C., a team known for its fierce determination and winning spirit. Around the same time, Harry also received an invitation to play for the London national football B team, an honor that filled him with pride and excitement.\n\nSeeking to expand his horizons further, Harry also took on a role with the Redwood Rovers, a local club that allowed him to connect with his roots and give back to the community that had supported him throughout his journey.\n\nAs the years progressed, Harry's talent only flourished. He continued to impress with his exceptional performances, representing the Greenland national under-21 football team until 2007. Subsequently, in 2008, he joined the Rapid City Raiders, a club known for its fast-paced style of play. Harry's time with the Raiders proved fruitful as he showcased his versatility as a player and left an indelible mark on the team.\n\nHowever, after a year with the Raiders, Harry decided it was time for a new challenge. He bid farewell to Rapid City in 2009 and took a brief hiatus from professional football to assess his path forward. During this break, he focused on refining his skills and nurturing his love for the sport.\n\nAfter a few years of self-discovery, Harry made a triumphant return to the field in 2013 when he joined the Silver Lake Galaxy.

"Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Austin, Texas, Oliver Thompson came into this world in the year 1860. From an early age, it was clear that Oliver possessed a bright and curious mind, always seeking knowledge and adventure.\n\nJust a few years later, in the tranquil town of Carlton, California, another Oliver was born - Oliver Simmons, in the year 1863. Despite being born in different states, fate had a peculiar plan in store for these two individuals who shared not only a name but also a remarkable connection.\n\nIn the year 1897, the paths of Oliver Thompson and Oliver Simmons finally crossed. They met at a social gathering and instantly felt an indescribable bond between them. As they got to know one another, they discovered their shared interests, dreams, and passions. It was as if their souls were intertwined, destined to be together.\n\nIn a whirlwind of emotions, Oliver Thompson and Oliver Simmons decided to unite in holy matrimony, promising to support and love each other unconditionally. Their love story quickly became legendary in their small community, where they were admired for their unwavering commitment and devotion to one another.\n\nBut life often tests the strength of even the most extraordinary love stories. Tragedy struck in 1931 when Oliver Thompson breathed his last breath in the peaceful town of Riverdale, Indiana. The loss was unbearable for Oliver Simmons, who now had to navigate the world alone, their hearts aching with grief.\n\nHowever, the remarkable bond they shared transcended even death. Oliver Thompson's memories and love continued to live on in Oliver Simmons' heart, guiding and comforting them through their solitary years. They cherished the life they had built together and sought solace in the legacy they had created.\n\nYears passed, and in 1948, Oliver Simmons also bid farewell to this world, leaving behind a remarkable tale of love, strength, and resilience. They found eternal peace in the very same town where their love story had blossomed, Riverdale, Indiana.\n\nTheir remarkable story still echoes through the generations, reminding us all that true love knows no boundaries or limitations. Oliver Thompson and Oliver Simmons, two souls united by an extraordinary bond, forever serve as an inspiration for those who believe in the enduring power of love.", "TG": "(Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas) starts at 1860\n(Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California) starts at 1863\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons) starts at 1897\n(Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson) starts at 1897\n(Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana) starts at 1931\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons) ends at 1931\n(Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson) ends at 1931\n(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana) starts at 1948\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas) or (Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas)", "(Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)?", "C": ["(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas) or (Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas)", "(Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons)?", "C": ["(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas)?", "C": ["(Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana) or (Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana)", "(Oliver Thompson was married to Oliver Simmons)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver Thompson was born in Austin, Texas), (Oliver Simmons was born in Carlton, California), (Oliver Thompson died in Riverdale, Indiana), (Oliver Simmons died in Riverdale, Indiana), (Oliver Simmons was married to Oliver Thompson).

and Oliver Harper were born in 1969. Little did they know, their lives were destined to intertwine in ways they could never have imagined.\n\nGrowing up in the same neighborhood, Ethan and Oliver were inseparable childhood friends. They shared countless adventures exploring the city streets, playing football at the local park, and dreaming of their futures. As the years went by, their friendship blossomed into something deeper, and they realized they were meant to be more than just friends.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Ethan and Oliver took the leap of faith and got married. Surrounded by their loved ones, they exchanged vows of lifelong commitment, promising to support and love each other in both good times and bad. Their love story became an inspiration to many, as they embraced their relationship with a kind of authenticity and fearlessness that touched the hearts of those around them.\n\nFor three blissful years, Ethan and Oliver reveled in the joys of matrimony. Their love filled their home with warmth and laughter, and they built a life together, dreaming of a future filled with endless possibilities. However, life has its own plans, and their marriage came to an end in 1999. Though the love between them remained, circumstances pushed them in different directions, and they decided to part ways amicably.\n\nIn the years that followed, both Ethan and Oliver continued their individual journeys, searching for happiness and fulfillment. It wasn't until 2005 that fate brought them back together when Oliver met a captivating soul named Sam Watson, who, coincidentally, was also born in Manchester in 1971. Sam and Oliver quickly fell head over heels in love, and their love story mirrored the intensity and passion Ethan and Oliver once shared.\n\nEthan, ever supportive of Oliver's happiness, witnessed their union and accepted the changes life had bestowed upon them. He understood that sometimes, the paths we travel lead us to unexpected destinations, and that true love transcends time and circumstances. Ethan formed a deep bond with Sam and celebrated the love they all shared.\n\nBut just as before, life had another twist in store. In 2013, after eight years of marriage, Sam and Oliver decided to part ways. The love that once burned fiercely between them had changed, and they both knew it was time to move on. Despite the dissolution of their marriage, they remained friends, cherishing the memories they built together and the growth they experienced during their time as partners.\n\nAnd so, as the story goes, Ethan, Oliver, and Sam continued their separate journeys, forever grateful for the love they had shared and the lessons they had learned. Their lives, entwined by the vibrant streets of Manchester, serves as a reminder that love knows no boundaries and that sometimes, the most meaningful connections are forged through unexpected circumstances.", "TG": "(Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester) starts at 1969\n(Oliver Harper was born in Manchester) starts at 1969\n(Sam Watson was born in Manchester) starts at 1971\n(Ethan Johnson was married to Oliver Harper) starts at 1996\n(Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson) starts at 1996\n(Ethan Johnson was married to Oliver Harper) ends at 1999\n(Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson) ends at 1999\n(Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper) starts at 2005\n(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson) starts at 2005\n(Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper) ends at 2013\n(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson) ends at 2013\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester) or (Sam Watson was born in Manchester)?", "C": ["(Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester)", "(Sam Watson was born in Manchester)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harper was born in Manchester) or (Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harper was born in Manchester)", "(Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harper was born in Manchester) or (Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harper was born in Manchester)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester) or (Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper)?", "C": ["(Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester)", "(Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Johnson was married to Oliver Harper) or (Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Johnson was married to Oliver Harper)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester) or (Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sam Watson was born in Manchester) or (Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)?", "C": ["(Sam Watson was born in Manchester)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson) or (Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sam Watson was born in Manchester) or (Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson)?", "C": ["(Sam Watson was born in Manchester)", "(Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver Harper was married to Ethan Johnson), (Oliver Harper was married to Sam Watson), (Ethan Johnson was born in Manchester), (Sam Watson was married to Oliver Harper), (Sam Watson was born in Manchester).

From a young age, it was evident that he possessed an extraordinary talent and a thirst for knowledge.\n\nAs Alex grew older, his passion for learning and exploration led him to achieve great milestones. In 1960, his exceptional work and dedication were recognized when he received the prestigious Steven Reynolds Trophy. This acknowledgment only fueled his determination to continue pushing boundaries and making groundbreaking discoveries.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Alex's brilliance shone even brighter. In 1984, he was honored with the Maverick Gold Award, which celebrated his influential contributions to his field. The following year, he achieved yet another remarkable feat by winning the Brooklyn Award, cementing his status as a pioneer.\n\nIn 1988, Alex's innovative breakthroughs became synonymous with his name. Not only did he win the esteemed International Prize for Technology, but he also received the distinguished Smithson Award. The world recognized his expertise and his ability to reshape the technological landscape.\n\nAlex's achievements didn't stop there. In 1989, he was honored with the Astoria Award in Cosmology, proving that his intellect spanned across various disciplines. The following year, he was once again recognized for his outstanding accomplishments, this time with the Thompson Award, solidifying his place among the greatest minds in history.\n\nTo further honor his unparalleled dedication and contributions to society, in 1995, Alex was bestowed with the Aiden Peterson Honor. This award not only highlighted his perseverance but also acknowledged his profound impact on the lives of countless individuals.\n\nThroughout his life, Alex Michael Thompson pushed the boundaries of what was thought to be imaginable. His dedication, passion, and relentless pursuit of knowledge left an indelible mark on the world.

Sullivan was born in the year 1889. Growing up, Liam was immersed in the rich culture and beauty of the city, nurtured by the love of his family.\n\nIn the nearby town of Greenville, a young girl named Caroline Hughes entered the world in 1900. Caroline's childhood was filled with laughter and warmth, surrounded by the picturesque landscapes of her hometown. As fate would have it, Liam and Caroline were destined to cross paths, and their lives intertwined in a beautiful love story.\n\nIn the year 1925, Liam and Caroline exchanged their heartfelt vows, binding their souls together in matrimony. Their love knew no bounds, and they embarked on a journey as husband and wife, cherishing each moment they shared. For twenty blissful years, they built a life together, weathering the storms of life and celebrating their triumphs.\n\nHowever, as time went on, their love story entered a new chapter. In 1945, after a life filled with love and devotion, Caroline and Liam decided to go their separate ways. Though their paths diverged, the memories they created together would forever hold a special place in their hearts.\n\nYears later, in 1952, Liam found himself captivated by the vibrant spirit of Joanna Williams. They took each other's hands in a promise of eternal support and love. In the following year, Liam and Joanna embarked on a new journey as husband and wife, their hearts entwined in a tapestry of shared dreams and aspirations.\n\nFor nearly three decades, Liam and Joanna lived in harmony, nurturing their love and creating a life brimming with joy. However, their love story, like all stories, eventually reached its final chapter. In the year 1980, Joanna left this earthly realm, her spirit soaring to new heights, leaving Liam filled with bittersweet memories and an eternal love that nothing could sever.\n\nCarrying the weight of loss, Liam honored Joanna's memory, cherishing the years they spent together. His heart yearned for the love he had lost, yet the memories of both Caroline and Joanna brought him comfort and solace.\n\nAnd so, in the year 1998, Liam found himself standing in Atlanta, the city where Joanna had taken her last breath. There, amidst the bustling streets and vibrant energy, Liam bid farewell to his beloved Joanna, knowing that her spirit would forever live on in his heart and memories.\n\nWith tears in his eyes, Liam Sullivan silently whispered his gratitude to the universe for the love he had experienced throughout his life. As he walked away from the city, memories of both Caroline and Joanna danced in his mind, etching an untold story of love, loss, and cherished moments that would forever be his own.", "TG": "(Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle) starts at 1889\n(Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville) starts at 1900\n(Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan) starts at 1925\n(Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes) starts at 1925\n(Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan) ends at 1945\n(Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes) ends at 1945\n(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan) starts at 1952\n(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan) ends at 1980\n(Liam Sullivan was married to Joanna Williams) ends at 1980\n(Joanna Williams died in Atlanta) starts at 1998\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle) or (Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle)", "(Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes) or (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes)", "(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan) or (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan)", "(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle) or (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle)", "(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville) or (Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville)", "(Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan) or (Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan)", "(Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan) or (Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan)", "(Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville) or (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville)", "(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Joanna Williams died in Atlanta) or (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Joanna Williams died in Atlanta)", "(Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville) or (Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes)?", "C": ["(Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville)", "(Liam Sullivan was married to Caroline Hughes)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Sullivan was born in Seattle), (Joanna Williams died in Atlanta), (Joanna Williams was married to Liam Sullivan), (Caroline Hughes was married to Liam Sullivan), (Caroline Hughes was born in Greenville).

Ethan Thompson was born in 1955. Known for its picturesque landscapes and close-knit community, it was the perfect place for Ethan to grow up. Nine years later, in the nearby Pyramid City, a girl named Sophia Johnson came into the world in 1964. \n\nAlthough they were born in different towns, their paths were destined to cross. As fate would have it, Ethan and Sophia found themselves drawn to each other, and in 1998, they decided to embark on a lifelong journey together. United in marriage, their love blossomed, and they created a home filled with warmth and affection.\n\nHowever, life sometimes takes unexpected turns, and after just three years of marriage, Ethan and Sophia sadly decided to part ways in 2001. Although their love had faded, they remained amicable, cherishing the memories they had created together.\n\nYears passed, and fate once again intervened. In 2009, Ethan encountered Lily Jenkins, a woman with a captivating spirit and a heart full of joy. Immediately drawn to each other's magnetic presence, they discovered a deep connection. Against all odds, Ethan and Lily decided to marry, beginning a new chapter in both of their lives.\n\nJupiter, the town that witnessed Ethan's birth, now became the setting for a vibrant and blissful love story.

a baby girl named Sophia Thompson was brought into the world in the year 1921. Growing up, she had a vibrant spirit and an adventurous soul.\n\nMeanwhile, in the neighboring town of Kensington, a lovely girl named Emily Parker was born three years later in 1924. Emily possessed a gentle nature and a deep curiosity about the world around her.\n\nAs fate would have it, the paths of Sophia and Emily would intertwine when they met in school. The stars aligned, and a beautiful bond formed between the two young girls. They became inseparable, sharing their dreams, secrets, and aspirations.\n\nAs the years went on, their friendship blossomed into a love that couldn't be denied. In the year 1947, Emily and Sophia made a momentous decision, pledging to spend the rest of their lives together. They exchanged vows, not just as partners in love but also as partners in life.\n\nThe surrounding community initially struggled to understand their unique bond, but as time passed, their love story became an inspiration to many. Their unwavering commitment to each other served as a beacon of hope and acceptance, gradually dispelling prejudice and spreading love throughout the town.\n\nHowever, life wasn't without its challenges. In 1953, Emily and Sophia faced a heartbreaking separation. External pressures became too great, and their marriage came to an end. Though their love for each other remained, circumstances forced them to part ways.\n\nYet, fate had another surprise in store. Several decades later, in 1988, Emily Parker passed away peacefully in the serene town of Riverside. The news shook Sophia to her core, as memories of their shared adventures and cherished moments came rushing back.\n\nGrief-stricken but determined to honor Emily's memory, Sophia decided to fulfill their shared dreams. She embarked on a journey to commemorate their love by bringing awareness to the struggles faced by same-sex couples and fighting for equality.\n\nIn her mission, Sophia found solace, strength, and a sense of purpose. Slowly, her efforts began to make an impact, touching the hearts and minds of people far and wide. Emily's legacy lived on, not just in Sophia's heart but in the positive change they had worked for together.\n\nFinally, in 1995, Sophia Thompson peacefully joined her beloved Emily, passing away in the town of Lancaster. As the community bid farewell to a remarkable woman, they also celebrated the incredible love that Sophia and Emily shared.\n\nTheir story became a part of Weston's history, its whispered tales of resilience, devotion, and the unyielding power of love passed down through generations. And in the hearts of those who heard it, Sophia and Emily's story served as a reminder that love knows no boundaries and that true love can endure, no matter the obstacles.", "TG": "(Sophia Thompson was born in Weston) starts at 1921\n(Emily Parker was born in Kensington) starts at 1924\n(Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson) starts at 1947\n(Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker) starts at 1947\n(Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson) ends at 1953\n(Emily Parker died in Riverside) starts at 1988\n(Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster) starts at 1995\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson) or (Emily Parker was born in Kensington)?", "C": ["(Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson)", "(Emily Parker was born in Kensington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Parker died in Riverside) or (Emily Parker was born in Kensington)?", "C": ["(Emily Parker died in Riverside)", "(Emily Parker was born in Kensington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was born in Weston) or (Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was born in Weston)", "(Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was born in Weston) or (Emily Parker was born in Kensington)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was born in Weston)", "(Emily Parker was born in Kensington)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster) or (Emily Parker was born in Kensington)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster)", "(Emily Parker was born in Kensington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was born in Weston) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was born in Weston)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Parker died in Riverside) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)?", "C": ["(Emily Parker died in Riverside)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson) or (Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster)?", "C": ["(Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson)", "(Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Parker was born in Kensington), (Emily Parker was married to Sophia Thompson), (Sophia Thompson was married to Emily Parker), (Sophia Thompson died in Lancaster), (Emily Parker died in Riverside).

{"story": "Once upon a time, in the vibrant city of San Francisco, a girl named Katherine Evans was born in the year 1908. She grew up in a loving family and always dreamed of finding her true love.\n\nMeanwhile, in the peaceful town of Oceanview, another girl named Emily Jones was born in 1910. Emily had a curious and adventurous spirit, always seeking new experiences.\n\nYears passed, and in 1916, a little girl named Emma Bennett was born in the quaint town of Harrison. She was a bright and cheerful child, bringing joy to everyone around her.\n\nAs fate would have it, Emily and Katherine's paths finally crossed in 1949, when they met and fell deeply in love. Their love knew no boundaries, and they decided to get married. They celebrated their union and embarked on a beautiful journey together.\n\nYears went by, and the love between Emily and Katherine flourished. However, their love story ended in 1958 when they decided, amicably, to part ways. Although their life paths diverged, the love they shared would forever be a cherished memory.\n\nBut love found its way back into Emily's life in 1965 when she married Emma Bennett. Their union was filled with warmth, understanding, and a deep connection. They embraced their love for each other and faced life's challenges together.\n\nUnfortunately, in 1978, Katherine Evans passed away in Brookville Heights, Boston. Her departure left a void in Emily's heart, but she found solace in the memories they had created and the love they had shared.\n\nIn 1988, tragedy struck once again when Emily herself passed away in Millwood Town, Austin. It was a heartbreaking loss for Emma, but she found comfort in the love they had shared during their years together.\n\nWith time, Emma found peace within herself, knowing that their love would always be alive in her heart. She lived the rest of her life embracing the memories they shared, surrounded by the beauty of Riverdale, Idaho, until she peacefully joined her beloved Emily in 1999.\n\nTheir love story, marked by its twists and turns, served as a testament to the power of love, resilience, and the profound impact two souls can have on each other's lives.

small town of Everfield, Michael Sullivan was born in 1984. Little did anyone know at the time, but Michael was destined to become a legendary athlete. Growing up, Michael had a deep passion for sports and excelled in multiple disciplines.\n\nIn 2002, Michael made his debut on the professional scene when he joined the renowned Houston Astros baseball team. His talent shone brightly, and his name quickly became synonymous with success. However, his stint with the Astros was short-lived, as he decided to pursue another sporting endeavor.\n\nIn 2003, Michael made a bold move and joined the prestigious Manchester United F.C., one of the most revered football clubs in the world. His skills on the field were admired by fans and fellow players alike. Yet, Michael's heart couldn't resist the call of his beloved baseball. Thus, he bid farewell to Manchester United and rejoined the Houston Astros briefly in the same year.\n\nBut Michael's wanderlust was far from over. In 2004, he embarked on a new adventure, joining the Liverpool Athletic Club. His time with the club was marked by numerous victories, and he became a fan favorite. However, Michael's versatility extended beyond football.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, he joined the Virginia national under-21 hockey team, showcasing his exceptional abilities on the ice. The crowds were captivated by his rapid moves and precise shots. But football was always his true love, and he returned to the pitch in 2007, signing with Forest United F.C.\n\nAs the years went by, Michael Sullivan's career continued its colorful trajectory. He played for a variety of teams, including the Manhattan Stars F.C., Iverson United in 2009, and eventually landed back at Manchester United in the same year. Each club experienced a surge of energy when Michael stepped onto the field.\n\nThings took a turn for Michael in 2010 when he joined Sapphire United F.C., only to leave shortly after. It seemed as though he was searching for a perfect fit. He briefly played for Ashford United F.C. and Brighton United F.C. in 2014 but couldn't find a long-term home.\n\nIn 2015, Michael found himself donning the jersey of Hartford United F.C. His leadership and experience guided the team to new heights, instilling a sense of unity and determination. The fans celebrated his arrival and felt a renewed sense of hope.\n\nHowever, in 2016, Michael decided to hang up his boots and retire from professional sports. His accomplishments were vast, his journey extraordinary. Michael Sullivan's name went down in the annals of sporting history as a versatile and gifted athlete who left an indelible mark in the hearts of fans worldwide. And though his playing days were over, his legend would live on forever.", "TG": "(Michael Sullivan was born in Everfield) starts at 1984\n(Michael Sullivan played for Houston Astros baseball team) starts at 2002\n(Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.) starts at 2003\n(Michael Sullivan played for Houston Astros baseball team) ends at 2003\n(Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club) starts at 2004\n(Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) starts at 2004\n(Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) ends at 2006\n(Michael Sullivan played for Forest United F.C.) starts at 2007\n(Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.) ends at 2007\n(Michael Sullivan played for Iverson United) starts at 2009\n(Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.) starts at 2009\n(Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.) starts at 2010\n(Michael Sullivan played for Iverson United) ends at 2010\n(Michael Sullivan played for Forest United F.C.) ends at 2010\n(Michael Sullivan played for Ashford United F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.) ends at 2015\n(Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.) starts at 2015\n(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) ends at 2015\n(Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.) ends at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.) or (Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club) or (Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) or (Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Sapphire United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Iverson United) or (Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Iverson United)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Michael Sullivan played for Forest United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Forest United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) or (Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team)", "(Michael Sullivan played for Hartford United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Sullivan played for Manchester United F.C.), (Michael Sullivan played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team), (Michael Sullivan played for Brighton United F.C.), (Michael Sullivan played for Liverpool Athletic Club), (Michael Sullivan played for Forest United F.C.).

world in the quaint town of Braydon. Growing up, John had dreams of adventure and excitement beyond the boundaries of his small town.\n\nMeanwhile, in the neighboring town of Harrison, a baby girl named Sophia Johnson was also born in the year 1918. Sophia had a spirited personality and always sought to make the most out of life.\n\nAs fate would have it, both John and Sophia eventually found themselves in the bustling city of Chicago by the year 1949. It was there that their paths crossed, and they fell deeply in love. In a small and intimate ceremony, John and Sophia exchanged vows and began their journey together as a married couple.\n\nHowever, their joy was short-lived, as Sophia's heart soon fell for another man named Colin Everett. In 1953, Sophia made the difficult decision to end her marriage with John and pursue her newfound love. John, though heartbroken, understood Sophia's feelings and agreed to the separation.\n\nSophia and Colin embraced their life together, and for the next two years, they reveled in their shared adventures. However, their love story came to a tragic end in 1955 when Colin passed away in the serene coastal town of Oceanview. Overwhelmed with grief, Sophia felt a profound loneliness that seemed impossible to fill.\n\nIn 1980, the city of Oakland became the final resting place for Sophia, as she peacefully bid farewell to the world. Her vibrant spirit had left an indelible mark on all those who knew her.\n\nIn the years that followed, Braydon, the town where John had been born, underwent significant changes. In 1990, John became the proud owner of Lakeview Stadium, a beloved local landmark that brought joy and camaraderie to the community.\n\nFor thirteen years, John poured his heart and soul into Lakeview Stadium, fostering a sense of unity and pride. But, in 2003, it was time for John to retire, and he sold the stadium, leaving behind a lasting legacy.\n\nAnd so, the story of John, Sophia, and Colin intertwines with the history of Braydon, Harrison, Chicago, Oceanview, and Oakland. Their lives encapsulate the beauty and complexity of love, loss, and the journey through time.", "TG": "(John Smith was born in Braydon) starts at 1911\n(Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison) starts at 1918\n(Colin Everett was born in Chicago) starts at 1918\n(Sophia Johnson was married to John Smith) starts at 1949\n(John Smith was married to Sophia Johnson) starts at 1949\n(Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett) starts at 1953\n(Sophia Johnson was married to John Smith) ends at 1953\n(John Smith was married to Sophia Johnson) ends at 1953\n(Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett) ends at 1955\n(Colin Everett died in Oceanview) starts at 1980\n(Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium) starts at 1990\n(Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium) ends at 2003\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Colin Everett was born in Chicago) or (Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium)?", "C": ["(Colin Everett was born in Chicago)", "(Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett) or (Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett)", "(Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith was born in Braydon) or (Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett)?", "C": ["(John Smith was born in Braydon)", "(Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith was born in Braydon) or (Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(John Smith was born in Braydon)", "(Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett) or (Colin Everett died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Sophia Johnson was married to Colin Everett)", "(Colin Everett died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium) or (Colin Everett died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium)", "(Colin Everett died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith was born in Braydon) or (Colin Everett died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(John Smith was born in Braydon)", "(Colin Everett died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Colin Everett was born in Chicago) or (Colin Everett died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Colin Everett was born in Chicago)", "(Colin Everett died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium) or (Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium)", "(Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith was born in Braydon) or (Colin Everett was born in Chicago)?", "C": ["(John Smith was born in Braydon)", "(Colin Everett was born in Chicago)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (John Smith was born in Braydon), (John Smith was married to Sophia Johnson), (Colin Everett was born in Chicago), (Sophia Johnson was born in Harrison), (Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium).

With a bright smile and curious nature, Maxwell grew up exploring the vibrant streets and finding joy in the simple pleasures of life.\n\nNearby, in the peaceful coastal town of Oceanview, Ava Thompson entered the world in 1964. With her adventurous spirit and love for the ocean, Ava spent her childhood building sandcastles and dreaming of exploring far-off lands.\n\nAs the years went by, Maxwell and Ava lived separate lives, unaware that their paths were destined to intersect. In 1982, fate intervened when they finally came face to face. They were drawn to each other's energy, finding solace in their shared dreams and aspirations. Recognizing the spark between them, they decided to embark on a beautiful journey together, exchanging vows in 1984.\n\nHowever, life has a way of throwing unexpected surprises our way. In 1966, in the city of Columbia, another soul entered the world. Patrick Stevenson grew up in a close-knit community, surrounded by love and support. He discovered his passion for music, dedicating countless hours to perfecting his craft.\n\nIn 1999, Ava Thompson's heart took an unexpected turn when she met Patrick Stevenson. They connected instantly, their souls resonating with each other's experiences and interests. Without hesitation, Ava and Patrick decided to take a leap of faith and start a new chapter of their lives together, exchanging vows in the same year.\n\nTheir story was one of complexity and intertwining paths. Though Ava had once been wed to Maxwell Foster, sometimes love evolves, leading us down unexplored roads. As they built their lives together, Ava and Patrick found solace in their shared passions for creativity, art, and adventure. They discovered the beauty in embracing change and the transformative power of love.\n\nAs the years went by, Ava, Patrick, and Maxwell continued to navigate life's joys and challenges. They found solace in their shared connections, learning to appreciate the unique relationships life had gifted them. Though their paths had diverged and intertwined in unexpected ways, the three individuals remained forever connected by the love they had once shared and the memories they had created together.\n\nAnd so, in this tale of intertwined lives, the journey continued. Each day brought new opportunities for growth, love, and the exploration of what it truly means to find happiness and fulfillment.", "TG": "(Maxwell Foster was born in Denver) starts at 1955\n(Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview) starts at 1964\n(Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia) starts at 1966\n(Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster) starts at 1982\n(Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson) starts at 1984\n(Patrick Stevenson was married to Ava Thompson) starts at 1999\n(Ava Thompson was married to Patrick Stevenson) starts at 1999\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Patrick Stevenson was married to Ava Thompson) or (Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson)?", "C": ["(Patrick Stevenson was married to Ava Thompson)", "(Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia) or (Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)", "(Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ava Thompson was married to Patrick Stevenson) or (Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster)?", "C": ["(Ava Thompson was married to Patrick Stevenson)", "(Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Foster was born in Denver) or (Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Foster was born in Denver)", "(Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Foster was born in Denver) or (Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Foster was born in Denver)", "(Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Foster was born in Denver) or (Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Foster was born in Denver)", "(Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Foster was born in Denver) or (Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Foster was born in Denver)", "(Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ava Thompson was married to Patrick Stevenson) or (Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)?", "C": ["(Ava Thompson was married to Patrick Stevenson)", "(Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster) or (Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)?", "C": ["(Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster)", "(Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Ava Thompson was born in Oceanview), (Ava Thompson was married to Maxwell Foster), (Maxwell Foster was born in Denver), (Patrick Stevenson was born in Columbia), (Maxwell Foster was married to Ava Thompson).

bustling city of San Francisco, Liam Brooks entered the world in 1885, with the vigor and curiosity that would shape his life. Meanwhile, in Denver, the lively spirit of Michael J. Foster was born four years later, in 1889.\n\nAs Liam and Michael grew older, their paths converged when fate brought them together in matrimony in 1918. Their deep love and unwavering support for one another created a bond that seemed unbreakable. They were constant companions, navigating the highs and lows of life together.\n\nTheir union, however, came to an unexpected end in 1925, leaving a void in both of their hearts. Michael sought solace in the arms of Emily Thompson, a vivacious woman from Denver. In 1926, they embarked on a new chapter as husband and wife, embracing the future with hopeful hearts.\n\nOver the years, Liam thrived in his artistic endeavors and became well-known for his exquisite paintings. His talent took him to the charming Brookville Heights, Boston, where he resided until his peaceful passing in 1965. His legacy as a gifted artist lived on in the hearts of those moved by his creations.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Michael led a fulfilling life as a philanthropist in Astonville, Alabama. His unwavering dedication to making a difference touched the lives of countless individuals. Sadly, in 1968, Michael bid farewell to this world, leaving behind a lasting impact on the communities he had served.\n\nEmily, who had stood by his side for more than four decades, faced her own journey's end in 1975, also in Astonville, Alabama. Her vivacious spirit and unwavering love for Michael had been a source of strength, inspiring those around her to embrace life with vibrancy and determination.\n\nThe intertwined lives of Liam, Michael, and Emily serve as a testament to the enduring power of love, friendship, and art. Though their paths continuously diverged and converged, their memories and the mark they left on the world would forever be etched in the hearts of those touched by their remarkable lives.", "TG": "(Liam Brooks was born in San Francisco) starts at 1885\n(Michael J.

From an early age, Harry displayed an exceptional intellect and an unwavering passion for technology and research.\n\nAs Harry grew older, his accomplishments began to shine like the stars in the night sky. In the year 1961, he received the prestigious Oakley Smith Prize, recognizing his groundbreaking achievements in the field of technology. This acknowledgment only propelled Harry further, inspiring him to reach new heights.\n\nIn that same year, another significant recognition came Harry's way. He was honored with the esteemed Jenkins Award for his remarkable contributions to the world of research. His relentless dedication and tireless efforts made him a beacon of inspiration for aspiring scientists and researchers.\n\nHarry's thirst for knowledge and innovation continued to lead him on an extraordinary path. In 1967, he once again made history by winning the New Name: International Prize for Technology. This honor celebrated not only his intellectual prowess but also his ability to transform theoretical concepts into practical applications that benefited society as a whole.\n\nWhile accolades continued to pour in, it was the year 1975 that marked a truly remarkable turning point in Harry's life. He was bestowed with the coveted Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research. This prestigious honor hailed Harry's relentless pursuit of scientific breakthroughs that revolutionized the way people thought and lived.\n\nYears passed, and Harry's impact on the world continued to grow. However, in 1987, the world mourned the loss of this great mind. Harry Anderson, the visionary scientist who had dedicated his life to exploring the unknown, passed away in the city of Columbus, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy.\n\nHarry's brilliance, determination, and unquenchable thirst for knowledge serve as a reminder to all that with dedication and passion, the human mind can achieve the extraordinary. His name forever etched in the annals of scientific history, inspiring generations to come to reach for the stars.", "TG": "(Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts) starts at 1894\n(Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize) starts at 1961\n(Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award) starts at 1961\n(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology) starts at 1967\n(Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research) starts at 1975\n(Harry Anderson died in Columbus) starts at 1987\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research) or (Harry Anderson died in Columbus)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research)", "(Harry Anderson died in Columbus)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize) or (Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize)", "(Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize) or (Harry Anderson died in Columbus)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize)", "(Harry Anderson died in Columbus)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson died in Columbus) or (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson died in Columbus)", "(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research) or (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research)", "(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize) or (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize)", "(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award) or (Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award)", "(Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology) or (Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)", "(Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award) or (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award)", "(Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research) or (Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize)?", "C": ["(Harry Anderson won prize Johnson Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research)", "(Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Harry Anderson won prize Oakley Smith Prize), (Harry Anderson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts), (Harry Anderson died in Columbus), (Harry Anderson won prize New name: International Prize for Technology), (Harry Anderson won prize Jenkins Award).

[]}}, {"story": "Once upon a time in Portland, a talented young boy named Ethan Mitchell was born in 1991. From a young age, it was clear that Ethan had a natural gift for sports and a burning passion to succeed.\n\nAs he grew older, Ethan's love for basketball took center stage. In 2009, he made his debut with the Chicago Bulls, where his skills shone brightly. His lightning-fast moves and precise shooting made him a valuable asset to the team.\n\nHowever, Ethan's talents weren't limited to just basketball. In the same year, he also represented the Golden State national under-19 football team. With his speed and agility, Ethan proved to be a remarkable football player as well.\n\nAfter a successful stint with the national team, Ethan decided to pursue his football career further. In 2010, he joined Blackburn Rovers F.C., a renowned English football club. His time with Blackburn showcased his versatility and determination on the field.\n\nBut Ethan's journey didn't stop there. In 2011, he embarked on a new adventure, joining the California Dolphins. This American football team provided Ethan with unique challenges, and his unwavering dedication led them to victory.\n\nEthan's talents caught the attention of Manchester United F.C., and in the same year, he joined their prestigious ranks. The opportunity to play for one of the most prominent football clubs in the world was an honor for him. With every match, Ethan left spectators awe-inspired by his skills and relentless drive to win.\n\nIn 2012, Ethan sought a new experience and joined Queensland United F.C., a team based in Australia. His impact was immediate, and he became a key figure in their success. Later that year, he moved on to Oakland United F.C., where he further cemented his reputation as a formidable player.\n\nIn 2013, Ethan briefly returned to his basketball roots and rejoined the Chicago Bulls. His presence on the court was electrifying, and his final season with the team was one to remember. However, his love for football never wavered, leading him back to Manchester United F.C., where he continued to showcase his exceptional skills.\n\nIn 2014, Ethan branched out yet again and became part of the Exeter City F.C. family. His natural talent seamlessly adapted to different teams and playing styles. He became an indispensable member of the team, leaving a lasting impact wherever he went.\n\nAfter a year with Exeter City, Ethan moved on to Westminster United in 2014. His time there was short-lived, but he made a significant contribution to their success. In 2015, he joined Greenwood United, where he played passionately until 2016.\n\nThrough his remarkable journey, Ethan Mitchell proved that dedication, talent, and versatility know no bounds. His inspiring sports career will forever be remembered as a testament to the heights one can achieve through hard work and determination.", "TG": "(Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland) starts at 1991\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Chicago Bulls) starts at 2009\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team) starts at 2009\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team) ends at 2010\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.) starts at 2010\n(Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins) starts at 2011\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Manchester United F.C.) starts at 2011\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Queensland United F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Oakland United F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United) starts at 2013\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Oakland United F.C.) ends at 2013\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Chicago Bulls) ends at 2013\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Manchester United F.C.) starts at 2013\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Exeter City F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United) ends at 2014\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Westminster United) starts at 2014\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Westminster United) ends at 2015\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Greenwood United) starts at 2015\n(Ethan Mitchell played for Greenwood United) ends at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Manchester United F.C.) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Westminster United)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Manchester United F.C.)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Westminster United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Chicago Bulls) or (Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Chicago Bulls)", "(Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Exeter City F.C.)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Exeter City F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland) or (Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Exeter City F.C.)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell was born in Portland)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Exeter City F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team) or (Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Golden State national under-19 football team)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for California Dolphins)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Mitchell played for Queensland United F.C.) or (Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United)?", "C": ["(Ethan Mitchell played for Queensland United F.C.)", "(Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Ethan Mitchell played for Queensland United F.C.), (Ethan Mitchell played for Manchester United F.C.), (Ethan Mitchell played for Brighton United), (Ethan Mitchell played for Blackburn Rovers F.C.), (Ethan Mitchell played for Chicago Bulls).

It was owned by the town itself and served as a symbol of community and prosperity. Construction on Oceanview began in 1976, and it quickly became a cherished landmark.\n\nJust a year later, in 1977, a lovely girl named Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown. As she grew up, she always found herself drawn to the magnificent Oceanview Building. Its grandeur and elegance captivated her from a young age, and she often dreamed of one day having a connection to it.\n\nIn 2007, Emily's dream came true when she married a kind-hearted man named James Davidson. Excitingly, James had a deep reverence for Oceanview as well. It was as if their shared admiration for the building was destiny bringing them together.\n\nThe couple's happiness flourished, and over the next two years, they built a beautiful life together. Unfortunately, tragedy struck in 2009 when Emily, unexpectedly, passed away in Oceanview. The building that had held so much enchantment for her became her final resting place. Devastated by the loss, James was left heartbroken and filled with grief.\n\nThe pain of losing Emily was unbearable for James, and in the wake of her passing, he sought solace in the memories they had shared. He reminisced about their marriage, the love they had shared, and the countless moments of happiness they had experienced together. James found comfort in knowing that Emily's final days had been spent in the place she had held so dear.\n\nIn 2010, tragedy struck Oceanview once again, as James Davidson, weighed down by the ache in his heart for too long, took his own life within its walls. The building that had witnessed so much love, pain, and sorrow now held the spirits of two souls forever connected by their love for Emily Thompson and their shared affinity for Oceanview.\n\nToday, the Oceanview Building stands as a hauntingly beautiful testament to the intertwined lives of Emily Thompson and James Davidson. People passing by can't help but feel a sense of melancholy mixed with awe as they admire its striking facade. Some even claim to hear faint whispers of a lost love lingering within its halls, a bittersweet reminder of the love story that unfolded and ended within its walls.", "TG": "(Yorktown owned Oceanview Building) starts at 1976\n(Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown) starts at 1977\n(Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson) starts at 2007\n(James Davidson was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 2007\n(Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) starts at 2009\n(Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson) ends at 2009\n(James Davidson was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 2009\n(James Davidson died in Oceanview) starts at 2010\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) or (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Oceanview)", "(Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) or (Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Oceanview)", "(Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) or (Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Oceanview)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown) or (James Davidson was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)", "(James Davidson was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building) or (Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)?", "C": ["(Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown) or (James Davidson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown)", "(James Davidson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building) or (Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson)?", "C": ["(Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)", "(Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) or (James Davidson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Oceanview)", "(James Davidson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building) or (James Davidson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)", "(James Davidson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown), (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview), (James Davidson was married to Emily Thompson), (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building), (Emily Thompson was married to James Davidson).

Simon grew up in a loving family and had a comfortable life. Little did he know that his path would cross with several other individuals who would shape his destiny.\n\nIn 1947, in the picturesque town of Riverton, Nevada, Lucas Mitchell was born. Lucas had a curious mind and a passion for storytelling. He dreamed of becoming a famous filmmaker one day.\n\nMeanwhile, in the quaint town of Greenwood, Megan Thompson came into the world in 1950. Megan was a creative soul, overflowing with ideas and determination. She possessed a natural talent for bringing stories to life.\n\nAs time went on, another person entered the picture. In 1955, Sophie Adams was born in the beautiful coastal town of Oceanview. Sophie had a captivating presence, radiating kindness and warmth wherever she went.\n\nIn 1958, Liam Henderson, a charismatic and adventurous soul, was born in the bustling city of Springfield. Liam had a zest for life and a knack for making things happen.\n\nIn 1976, Megan Thompson, always seeking new artistic endeavors, created Lucas Mitchell. Megan recognized Lucas's talent and saw potential in him. She became his creative mentor, guiding him along his path to success.\n\nThree years later, in 1979, Megan Thompson and Simon Miller tied the knot. Their love bloomed, and together, they embarked on a journey filled with joy and companionship. They shared a deep connection and supported each other's dreams.\n\nShortly afterward, in 1980, Megan Thompson brought one of her ideas to life when she created the renowned film \"Sightfinder.\" The movie took the world by storm, winning numerous accolades and propelling Megan to the height of her career.\n\nHowever, as life often takes unexpected turns, Megan and Simon's marriage came to an end in 1984. They realized that their paths were leading them in different directions, and they decided to part ways amicably.\n\nBut Megan's passion for storytelling never waned. In 1987, she created another masterpiece, \"Max Steel,\" captivating audiences with its thrilling storyline and incredible visual effects.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1991, Simon Miller and Sophie Adams found solace in each other's company. Their shared interests and unwavering support for each other brought them closer, resulting in a blissful marriage.\n\nAround the same time, Megan Thompson and Liam Henderson decided to tie the knot in 1992. Their adventurous spirits and shared love for art made them a perfect match. Their union was filled with laughter, exploration, and beautiful memories.\n\nHowever, just a year later, in 1993, Megan and Liam's marriage came to an end. They realized that their dreams and aspirations were pulling them in different directions. Despite the end of their romantic relationship, they remained friends and supported each other's endeavors.\n\nSimilarly, Sophie and Simon's marriage also came to a close in 1993. They realized that their paths had diverged, and it was time to move forward separately. Despite the end of their marriage, they remained on good terms and cherished the memories they had created together.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Simon Miller, Lucas Mitchell, Megan Thompson, Sophie Adams, and Liam Henderson continued to intertwine, each following their own unique paths. Their stories were woven together, creating a tapestry of creativity, love, and growth that would forever be remembered in the hearts of those who witnessed their journey.", "TG": "(Simon Miller was born in Scarborough, Maine) starts at 1940\n(Lucas Mitchell was born in Riverton, Nevada) starts at 1947\n(Megan Thompson was born in Greenwood) starts at 1950\n(Sophie Adams was born in Oceanview) starts at 1955\n(Liam Henderson was born in Springfield) starts at 1958\n(Megan Thompson created Lucas Mitchell) starts at 1976\n(Simon Miller was married to Megan Thompson) starts at 1979\n(Megan Thompson was married to Simon Miller) starts at 1979\n(Megan Thompson created Sightfinder (film)) starts at 1980\n(Megan Thompson was married to Simon Miller) ends at 1984\n(Megan Thompson created Max Steel) starts at 1987\n(Simon Miller was married to Sophie Adams) starts at 1991\n(Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller) starts at 1991\n(Megan Thompson was married to Liam Henderson) starts at 1992\n(Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson) starts at 1992\n(Megan Thompson was married to Liam Henderson) ends at 1993\n(Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson) ends at 1993\n(Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller) ends at 1993\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was born in Greenwood) or (Megan Thompson created Max Steel)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was born in Greenwood)", "(Megan Thompson created Max Steel)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller) or (Lucas Mitchell was born in Riverton, Nevada)?", "C": ["(Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller)", "(Lucas Mitchell was born in Riverton, Nevada)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller) or (Megan Thompson created Max Steel)?", "C": ["(Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller)", "(Megan Thompson created Max Steel)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Simon Miller was married to Megan Thompson) or (Sophie Adams was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Simon Miller was married to Megan Thompson)", "(Sophie Adams was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Simon Miller was married to Sophie Adams) or (Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Simon Miller was married to Sophie Adams)", "(Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson) or (Megan Thompson created Max Steel)?", "C": ["(Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson)", "(Megan Thompson created Max Steel)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Simon Miller was born in Scarborough, Maine) or (Megan Thompson created Max Steel)?", "C": ["(Simon Miller was born in Scarborough, Maine)", "(Megan Thompson created Max Steel)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was married to Simon Miller) or (Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was married to Simon Miller)", "(Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Adams was born in Oceanview) or (Simon Miller was born in Scarborough, Maine)?", "C": ["(Sophie Adams was born in Oceanview)", "(Simon Miller was born in Scarborough, Maine)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Lucas Mitchell was born in Riverton, Nevada), (Simon Miller was married to Sophie Adams), (Liam Henderson was married to Megan Thompson), (Megan Thompson was married to Liam Henderson), (Sophie Adams was married to Simon Miller).

a talented athlete, was born in Austin in the year 1983. From a young age, it was evident that sports were his passion. As he grew up, he found success in various sports, starting with the London Sporting Club in 2000.\n\nHowever, Adam's versatility led him to explore different avenues, and in 2001, he joined the Denver national under-20 basketball team. With his exceptional skills, he quickly became an integral part of the team. But Adam's hunger for new challenges led him to simultaneously try his hand at soccer.\n\nIn the same year, Adam joined the Seattle Soccer Club. Playing alongside his soccer teammates, he honed his skills and showcased his talent on the field. The following year, he ventured into international territory and played for the Greenland national under-21 football team in 2003.\n\nDespite his success, Adam's journey with the London Sporting Club came to an end in 2003, as did his time with the Denver national under-20 basketball team. However, he wasn't disheartened as new opportunities awaited him.\n\nIn 2004, Adam found himself joining L.J. Queensborough, a team that provided him with an entirely different experience. A year later, he joined Blueberry City FC, where he exhibited his soccer prowess once again.\n\nUnfortunately, his time with the Greenland national under-21 football team concluded in 2005. Similarly, his stints with L.J. Queensborough and Blueberry City FC came to an end, leaving Adam eager for fresh challenges.\n\nOpportunity knocked on his door once more in 2006 when he joined Phoenix United. With a burst of energy, Adam left an indelible mark on the team. Regrettably, his time with the Blazing Tigers (Hartford) and Blueberry City FC came to an end that same year.\n\nHowever, Adam's love for soccer persisted. In 2007, he joined Acme United F.C., determined to make a lasting impact. Despite his efforts, his journey with Phoenix United concluded in 2007, followed by his time with Acme United F.C. in 2009.\n\nYears passed, but Adam's passion and dedication to the sport remained unwavering. In 2011, he found himself joining the Lancaster United soccer club, where he hoped to find fulfillment and further his success.\n\nAdam Johnson's life had been filled with triumphs, setbacks, and lessons learned along the way. And as he stepped onto the field once again, he carried with him the determination to leave an everlasting mark on the world of soccer.", "TG": "(Adam Johnson was born in Austin) starts at 1983\n(Adam Johnson played for London Sporting Club) starts at 2000\n(Adam Johnson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) starts at 2001\n(Adam Johnson played for Seattle Soccer Club) starts at 2001\n(Adam Johnson played for Blazing Tigers (Hartford)) starts at 2003\n(Adam Johnson played for Greenland national under-21 football team) starts at 2003\n(Adam Johnson played for London Sporting Club) ends at 2003\n(Adam Johnson played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) ends at 2003\n(Adam Johnson played for L.J.

From a very young age, it was clear that Jordan had an extraordinary talent for soccer.\n\nIn 1984, Jordan joined the renowned Crimsonville national under-16 soccer club. He quickly became a standout player, mesmerizing the crowd with his skills on the field. Jordan's time with Crimsonville continued until 1985, where he left an indelible mark on the team's history.\n\nIn 1986, Jordan's journey took him to Arizona City, where he joined the national under-18 football team. His exceptional abilities earned him recognition and respect amongst his teammates and opponents alike.\n\nTwo years later, in 1988, Jordan found himself playing for VQ Malvern Wanderers. He showcased his versatility on the field and proved to be a valuable asset to the team. However, his time with VQ Malvern Wanderers was short-lived as he moved to Blue Thunder United in 1989.\n\nUnfortunately, Jordan's tenure with Blue Thunder United was cut short, and he returned to VQ Malvern Wanderers the same year. Despite the brief setback, Jordan continued to strive for excellence.\n\nIn 1990, Jordan joined the prestigious Greenwich national soccer club, where he thrived under the guidance of seasoned coaches and played alongside some of the best players in the country. The experience molded him into an even more formidable athlete.\n\nJordan's talent became widely recognized, and in 1991 he received an offer to play for the renowned Manchester United. Simultaneously, he also joined United Tigers, showcasing his dedication to the sport by playing for two clubs at once. However, his time with Blue Thunder United ended in the same year.\n\nContinuing his football journey, Jordan joined Valencia United in 1992. The club provided him with the platform to further flaunt his skills and grow as a player. However, his time with Manchester United concluded in 1992.\n\nJordan's determination led him to continue seeking new challenges. In 1993, he joined London United, further expanding his football horizons. The following year, in 1994, Jordan briefly played for Manchester City, leaving an impression on both his teammates and fans.\n\nHowever, Jordan took a break from professional soccer and did not join any clubs until 1997 when he signed with Redwood Rovers. He reignited his passion for the game, mesmerizing the crowd with his skillful play.\n\nA few years later, in 1999, Jordan embarked on a new chapter by joining FC Richmond. He brought his experience and leadership to the team, becoming an integral part of their success. Jordan's time with FC Richmond concluded in 2000, marking the end of an incredible era for the talented athlete.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Jordan Thompson's name became synonymous with skill, dedication, and passion for the beautiful game. His journey from humble beginnings in Wilmington to playing for esteemed clubs like Manchester United and Valencia United serves as an inspiration to aspiring soccer players around the world.", "TG":

Little did he know that his life would intertwine with two remarkable individuals who would shape his destiny.\n\nIn 1917, another San Franciscan, John Marshall, was born. Although he would later become a renowned playwright, his path would cross with Henry's in ways they could never have anticipated.\n\nJust a year later, in 1918, a girl named Samantha Johnson entered the world in Riverside, California. Samantha possessed a charm and grace that would capture the hearts of those around her, including both Henry and John.\n\nIt wasn't until 1942 that fate finally brought Henry and Samantha together in holy matrimony. The two embarked on a beautiful journey of love and companionship, cherishing every moment they shared as husband and wife.\n\nTheir joy and happiness lasted for a decade, until 1952 when their union came to an end. Though their love had faded, the memories of their time together remained etched in their hearts forever.\n\nIn 1959, Samantha found solace and love once again, this time in the arms of John Marshall. The playwright, captivated by Samantha's elegance, swept her off her feet, and they embarked on a new chapter together.\n\nFor almost two decades, Samantha and John thrived as a couple, nurturing their shared passions for art, theatre, and literature. Their love blossomed against the backdrop of San Francisco's artistic scene.\n\nSadly, in 1978, their love story came to a bittersweet end. John Marshall passed away, leaving Samantha to remember their shared adventures and the great love they once shared.\n\nAs the years went by, Henry found himself living in Dallas, Texas, where he eventually took his last breath in 1991. Though he had moved on from Samantha, his memories of their time together remained a cherished piece of his past.\n\nFinally, in 2005, Samantha Johnson bid farewell to this world in Fairfield, California. She left behind a legacy of grace, elegance, and a profound impact on the lives of those she encountered throughout her remarkable journey.\n\nThen, in 2009, the city of San Francisco mourned the loss of John Marshall, the talented playwright who had left an indelible mark on the world of theatre.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Henry Evans, Samantha Johnson, and John Marshall may have followed distinct paths, but their stories remained intertwined throughout the tapestry of time, leaving behind a tale of love, loss, and the enduring power of connection.", "TG": "(Henry Evans was born in San Francisco) starts at 1903\n(John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco) starts at 1917\n(Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside) starts at 1918\n(Henry Evans was married to Samantha Johnson) starts at 1942\n(Samantha Johnson was married to Henry Evans) starts at 1942\n(Henry Evans was married to Samantha Johnson) ends at 1952\n(Samantha Johnson was married to Henry Evans) ends at 1952\n(John Marshall (playwright) was married to Samantha Johnson) starts at 1959\n(Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright)) starts at 1959\n(John Marshall (playwright) was married to Samantha Johnson) ends at 1978\n(Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright)) ends at 1978\n(Henry Evans died in Dallas) starts at 1991\n(Samantha Johnson died in Fairfield, California) starts at 2005\n(John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco) starts at 2009\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside) or (Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))?", "C": ["(Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside)", "(Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside) or (John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside)", "(John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco) or (Henry Evans was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco)", "(Henry Evans was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco) or (John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco)", "(John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Henry Evans was born in San Francisco) or (Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))?", "C": ["(Henry Evans was born in San Francisco)", "(Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco) or (Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))?", "C": ["(John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco)", "(Samantha Johnson was married to John Marshall (playwright))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Johnson died in Fairfield, California) or (John Marshall (playwright) was married to Samantha Johnson)?", "C": ["(Samantha Johnson died in Fairfield, California)", "(John Marshall (playwright) was married to Samantha Johnson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside) or (John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Samantha Johnson was born in Riverside)", "(John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Henry Evans was born in San Francisco) or (Henry Evans died in Dallas)?", "C": ["(Henry Evans was born in San Francisco)", "(Henry Evans died in Dallas)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Henry Evans was married to Samantha Johnson), (John Marshall (playwright) was married to Samantha Johnson), (Samantha Johnson was married to Henry Evans), (John Marshall (playwright) was born in San Francisco), (John Marshall (playwright) died in San Francisco).

Liam grew up in a loving family, surrounded by the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, in Oakland in 1940, a girl named Emily Peterson came into the world, bringing joy to her parents' lives.\n\nAs time went by, Liam and Emily's paths crossed in the most unexpected way. In 1974, they fell deeply in love and decided to embark on a lifelong journey together, exchanging vows in matrimony. Their love radiated like the rays of the California sun, brightening everyone's lives around them.\n\nIn 1977, fueled by his passion for storytelling, Liam authored his first book called \"Harmony.\" The novel captivated readers' hearts, showcasing Liam's exceptional talent. The following year, his incredible work was recognized and awarded the prestigious Franklin Honor. Respect and admiration poured in for Liam, solidifying his place among the literary greats of his time.\n\nHowever, as life often presents unforeseen challenges, Liam and Emily's love story took an unfortunate turn. In 1979, they decided to part ways, realizing it was the best choice for their individual growth and happiness.\n\nYears went by, and Emily found solace in Fairfield, where she met an extraordinary man named Tom Mitchell. In 1992, Emily and Tom united their lives in marriage, creating a beautiful bond that filled their hearts with joy and contentment.\n\nMeanwhile, Liam continued his writing endeavors and became a beloved author, captivating readers from around the world with his unique style and powerful narratives. However, the passing years took their toll, and in 2016, Liam Watson bid farewell to the world he had touched so deeply, leaving behind an incredible legacy for future generations to cherish.\n\nThe story of Liam, Emily, and Tom reminds us that life is an ever-evolving journey filled with love, passion, and unexpected twists. While their paths diverged, their stories intertwined, ultimately creating a breathtaking tapestry of emotions, experiences, and lasting connections that stood the test of time.", "TG": "(Liam Watson was born in Seattle) starts at 1935\n(Emily Peterson was born in Oakland) starts at 1940\n(Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson) starts at 1974\n(Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson) starts at 1974\n(Liam Watson created Harmony (Liam book)) starts at 1977\n(Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson) ends at 1979\n(Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson) ends at 1979\n(Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson) starts at 1992\n(Emily Peterson was married to Tom Mitchell) starts at 1992\n(Liam Watson died in Glenville) starts at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was born in Seattle) or (Emily Peterson was married to Tom Mitchell)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was born in Seattle)", "(Emily Peterson was married to Tom Mitchell)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was born in Seattle) or (Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was born in Seattle)", "(Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson) or (Emily Peterson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson)", "(Emily Peterson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was born in Seattle) or (Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was born in Seattle)", "(Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was born in Seattle) or (Emily Peterson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was born in Seattle)", "(Emily Peterson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson died in Glenville) or (Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson died in Glenville)", "(Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson died in Glenville) or (Emily Peterson was married to Tom Mitchell)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson died in Glenville)", "(Emily Peterson was married to Tom Mitchell)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson) or (Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)?", "C": ["(Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson)", "(Emily Peterson was married to Liam Watson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Watson was born in Seattle) or (Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson)?", "C": ["(Liam Watson was born in Seattle)", "(Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Watson was born in Seattle), (Emily Peterson was born in Oakland), (Tom Mitchell was married to Emily Peterson), (Liam Watson was married to Emily Peterson), (Liam Watson died in Glenville).

small town of Yorktown, a baby boy named Oliver Robinson was born in 1942. Oliver grew up in a loving family, cherishing the close-knit community and beautiful surroundings of his hometown.\n\nYears passed, and in 1954, a little girl named Emily Thompson was born in the bustling city of Atlanta. Emily's family was always on the move, experiencing the excitement of city life. However, Emily longed for a peaceful place like Yorktown, where she could truly find solace.\n\nIn 1955, another baby girl entered the world, Megan Thompson, in the coastal town of Ocean City. Megan grew up admiring the vastness of the ocean and the tranquility it brought to her heart. She believed in the power of love and always dreamt of finding someone who would understand her deepest desires.\n\nIt wasn't until 1981, fate brought Megan Thompson and Oliver Robinson together. They met in a chance encounter, instantly connecting through their shared compassion for others. In the midst of their blossoming romance, Megan and Oliver decided to exchange vows, promising to be each other's lifelong support.\n\nFor a few blissful years, Oliver and Megan enjoyed the serenity of their love. However, in 1985, life took an unexpected turn. Their once dreamlike relationship started to crumble, and the couple decided it was best to part ways. Although their love had faded, Oliver and Megan remained respectful of one another, cherishing the memories they had created.\n\nIn 1987, Emily Thompson crossed paths with Oliver Robinson. Drawn to each other's magnetic presence, they quickly realized that their souls shared a profound connection. Fueling their undeniable attraction, Emily and Oliver decided to unite in marriage, hoping to heal their past wounds and create a brighter future together.\n\nTheir love burned fiercely, but sadly, it flickered out quickly. Emily and Oliver discovered that the timing was not right, and they needed to explore different paths. In 1988, with bittersweet farewells, they bid each other goodbye, knowing that their hearts would forever hold a special place for the other.\n\nAs the years went on, Oliver Robinson never forgot the impact both Megan and Emily had on his life. He cherished the lessons learned, the love shared, and the memories created. Oliver continued to embrace the simplicity of life in Yorktown, finding comfort in the supportive community that had shaped him.\n\nAnd so, the stories of Oliver Robinson, Megan Thompson, and Emily Thompson serve as reminders that life is a journey of unexpected encounters, fleeting moments of happiness, and the eternal search for love and fulfillment. In the end, they discovered that the true essence of life lies in embracing every twist and turn, appreciating the people who come and go, and finding solace in the places we call home.", "TG": "(Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown) starts at 1942\n(Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta) starts at 1954\n(Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City) starts at 1955\n(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) starts at 1981\n(Oliver Robinson was married to Megan Thompson) starts at 1981\n(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) ends at 1985\n(Oliver Robinson was married to Megan Thompson) ends at 1985\n(Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) starts at 1987\n(Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1987\n(Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) ends at 1988\n(Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 1988\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Robinson was married to Megan Thompson) or (Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Robinson was married to Megan Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City) or (Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City) or (Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown) or (Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown)", "(Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta) or (Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta)", "(Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) or (Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)", "(Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City) or (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City)", "(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City) or (Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City)", "(Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson) or (Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Atlanta)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Megan Thompson was born in Ocean City), (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Robinson), (Oliver Robinson was married to Megan Thompson), (Oliver Robinson was born in Yorktown), (Oliver Robinson was married to Emily Thompson).

on a remarkable journey through various football clubs. His passion for the sport was evident right from his early days when he joined Bluefield national under-17 football team in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, Oliver's skills caught the attention of prestigious Manchester United F.C., where he had the opportunity to showcase his talent. However, his desire for more playing time led him to join the Birmingham Lions football club the same year. Although his time with the Lions was short-lived, it was a stepping stone for his career.\n\nUndeterred by the setback, Oliver found a new home with Cameron Town Football Club in 2006, where he gained valuable experience and honed his abilities. His remarkable performances caught the eye of the national under-21 football team, and he proudly represented the Baltimore Eagles from 2007 to 2008. \n\nSeeking fresh challenges, Oliver decided to test his mettle at Liverpool United F.C. in 2008. However, the allure of returning to Manchester United proved too strong, and he made his way back to the legendary club. In 2009, he briefly played for Iverson United before moving on to Riverside United F.C. and Union City United F.C. the same year.\n\nThroughout his footballing journey, Oliver never lost sight of his dreams. In 2011, he signed with the spirited Newport City F.C., where he truly flourished and became an integral part of the team. But life is full of surprises, and in 2012, he made a switch to Brighton United F.C., seeking a new environment to challenge himself.\n\nSadly, Oliver's time with Riverside United and Brighton United came to an end in 2012 and 2014, respectively. However, he remained determined to continue pursuing his passion for the beautiful game.\n\nOliver Thompson's story is one of perseverance, adaptability, and unwavering dedication to his craft. With each chapter of his career, he added valuable experiences that molded him into the extraordinary footballer he is today. And as he embarks on new adventures, Oliver's talent and love for the game will undoubtedly lead him to even greater heights.", "TG": "(Oliver Thompson (footballer) was born in Ashton (city)) starts

Denver, Colorado, a brilliant individual named Liam Anderson came into this world in the year 1934. From the very beginning, it was evident that Liam possessed an extraordinary intellect and a hunger for knowledge that surpassed his peers.\n\nAs Liam grew older, he found himself drawn to the realms of academia. In 1959, he was admitted to the prestigious Crestwood College, where he eagerly immersed himself in various subjects, ranging from biology to physics. His dedication and passion for learning flourished, and he became known as a notable scholar among his professors and peers.\n\nIt was during his time at Crestwood College that Liam's exceptional abilities caught the attention of the scientific community. In 1972, at the mere age of 38, he was awarded the renowned Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research. This recognition further solidified his status as an influential figure in the world of academia.\n\nDetermined to leave no stone unturned in his pursuit of knowledge, Liam delved even deeper into his research. His efforts bore fruit in 1977 when he received the esteemed Steven Reynolds Trophy, representing his outstanding contributions to his field of expertise.\n\nAs the new millennium approached, Liam's thirst for new discoveries remained unquenchable. In the year 2000, his groundbreaking work earned him the highly sought-after Golden Trophy, a symbol of his continued dedication and innovative thinking.\n\nAmidst the accolades and achievements, Liam never lost sight of his true passion: astronomy. In 2015, as he gazed at the celestial wonders above, he was awarded the prestigious Lion Medal in Astronomy. This remarkable recognition not only highlighted his unrivaled expertise but also showcased his unwavering commitment to unraveling the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThroughout his extraordinary journey, Liam Anderson set the standards for scientific research and academic excellence. His insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge propelled him to new heights, making him a true trailblazer in his field. And as he continued to make groundbreaking discoveries, he inspired countless aspiring scientists to follow their dreams and forge their paths toward greatness.", "TG": "(Liam Anderson was born in Denver) starts at 1934\n(Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College) starts at 1959\n(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) starts at 1972\n(Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy) starts at 1977\n(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy) starts at 2000\n(Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy) starts at 2015\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College) or (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson was born in Denver) or (Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson was born in Denver)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy) or (Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) or (Liam Anderson was born in Denver)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)", "(Liam Anderson was born in Denver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy) or (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College) or (Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College) or (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy) or (Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Lion Medal in Astronomy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) or (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy) or (Liam Anderson was born in Denver)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy)", "(Liam Anderson was born in Denver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Anderson won prize Steven Reynolds Trophy), (Liam Anderson studied in Crestwood College), (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Trophy), (Liam Anderson was born in Denver), (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research).

From a young age, he displayed a love for sports, particularly football. As soon as he reached the appropriate age, Samuel joined the Riverside United Academy in 1999, where his skills on the field began to develop.\n\nIn the same year, Samuel also had the opportunity to play for Hillside United F.C., a local team that recognized his talent. However, his time with Hillside United F.C. was short-lived, and by 2000, he moved on to join the Quincy Tigers AFC. Samuel's dedication and passion for football were evident on the field, and he continued to impress.\n\nNot only did Samuel excel in football, but he also had a hidden talent on the ice. He joined the Virginia national under-21 hockey team in 2000, showcasing his versatility and athletic abilities. However, his time with the hockey team came to an end in 2001.\n\nFootball remained Samuel's primary focus, and he returned to play for the Riverdale United football club in 2000. For the next few years, he dedicated himself to the team, never failing to impress with his skills and determination. Unfortunately, his tenure with Riverdale United came to an end in 2005.\n\nBut Samuel's journey was far from over. In 2006, he joined Sunset City FC, a team that welcomed him with open arms. His time with Quincy Tigers AFC also came to a close in the same year.\n\nSamuel's passion for football continued to drive him, and in 2007, he signed on with Springfield United. He exhibited his talent and leadership skills, becoming an invaluable member of the team. During this time, he also joined Mountain Ridge United F.C., further expanding his horizons and proving his mettle on the field.\n\nAfter three fruitful years, Samuel bid farewell to Springfield United in 2010. He joined Sanford City F.C. to embark on a new chapter in his football career. However, his time with Sanford City was short-lived, coming to an end in 2012.\n\nUndeterred, Samuel sought new opportunities and found himself playing for the prestigious Soccer Club Miami in the same year. His time in Miami brought him new experiences and challenges, shaping him into an even stronger player.\n\nIn 2013, Samuel joined the Northfield City Football Club, eager to make his mark once again. His exceptional skills caught the attention of Winston City F.C., and by 2014, he found himself a part of their esteemed team. However, his brief stint with Winston City F.C. concluded later that year.\n\nSamuel Parker's football journey was one of perseverance, dedication, and a deep love for the sport. Throughout the years, he showcased his talent with various teams, leaving a lasting impact wherever he went. His passion for football would continue to drive him, as he eagerly awaited the next chapter in his remarkable career.", "TG": "(Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon) starts at 1980\n(Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy) starts at 1999\n(Samuel Parker played for Hillside United F.C.) starts at 1999\n(Samuel Parker played for Quincy Tigers AFC) starts at 2000\n(Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club) starts at 2000\n(Samuel Parker played for Hillside United F.C.) ends at 2000\n(Samuel Parker played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) starts at 2000\n(Samuel Parker played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) ends at 2001\n(Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club) ends at 2005\n(Samuel Parker played for Sunset City FC) starts at 2006\n(Samuel Parker played for Quincy Tigers AFC) ends at 2006\n(Samuel Parker played for Springfield United) starts at 2007\n(Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.) starts at 2007\n(Samuel Parker played for Springfield United) ends at 2010\n(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) starts at 2010\n(Samuel Parker played for Soccer Club Miami) starts at 2012\n(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) ends at 2012\n(Samuel Parker played for Northfield City Football Club) starts at 2013\n(Samuel Parker played for Winston City F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Samuel Parker played for Northfield City Football Club) ends at 2014\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker played for Sunset City FC)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker played for Sunset City FC)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team) or (Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Virginia national under-21 hockey team)", "(Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon) or (Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon)", "(Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Soccer Club Miami) or (Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Soccer Club Miami)", "(Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker played for Soccer Club Miami)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker played for Soccer Club Miami)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Winston City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Winston City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Northfield City Football Club) or (Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Northfield City Football Club)", "(Samuel Parker played for Riverdale United football club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.) or (Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)?", "C": ["(Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.)", "(Samuel Parker played for Riverside United Academy)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Samuel Parker played for Northfield City Football Club), (Samuel Parker played for Sanford City F.C.), (Samuel Parker played for Mountain Ridge United F.C.), (Samuel Parker played for Quincy Tigers AFC), (Samuel Parker was born in Sheffield upon Avon).

"Once upon a time in 1922, a baby boy named Oliver Harrison was born in the vibrant city of Portland. Little did he know that his life would intertwine with another person who was born in the serene town of Greenwood in 1928, Samantha Anderson.\n\nAs life carried on, Oliver and Samantha followed separate paths, unaware of the future that awaited them. It wasn't until 1947 that their lives collided in a beautiful twist of fate. Samantha and Oliver found themselves drawn to each other, bound by love, and decided to tie the knot. The year 1947 marked the beginning of their journey together as husband and wife.\n\nFor decades, Samantha and Oliver embraced the joys and challenges of a shared life. Their marriage was a testament to dedication and affection, as they navigated the ups and downs with unwavering support for one another. Through the years, their love story grew stronger, as did their connection to their beloved Portland.\n\nTime flew by, and their love story came to a bittersweet end in 1991. Samantha Anderson and Oliver Harrison departed this world, leaving behind a legacy of love and cherished memories for all who knew them.\n\nAmidst the ebb and flow of life, something unexpected happened in 2002. The city of Portland became the proud owner of the iconic Wembley Stadium. An extraordinary acquisition for the city, it marked a new era of excitement and grandeur for the people of Portland.\n\nThe years passed, and in 2013, Samantha Anderson bid her final farewell to this world in the very city where she was born, Portland. Her departure left Oliver with a void that no one could fill.\n\nFour years later, in 2017, Portland's ownership of Wembley Stadium came to an end. But the memories of those glory days would forever linger in the hearts of the city's residents, reminding them of a time when dreams came true.\n\nAnd so, the story of Oliver Harrison, Samantha Anderson, and the city of Portland continues to be told, intertwining their lives with the tapestry of history. A tale of love, commitment, and unexpected turns, reminding us that sometimes the greatest stories are shaped by the most genuine connections between people and places.", "TG": "(Oliver Harrison was born in Portland) starts at 1922\n(Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood) starts at 1928\n(Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison) starts at 1947\n(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson) starts at 1947\n(Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison) ends at 1991\n(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson) ends at 1991\n(Portland owned Wembley Stadium) starts at 2002\n(Samantha Anderson died in Portland) starts at 2013\n(Portland owned Wembley Stadium) ends at 2017\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Portland owned Wembley Stadium) or (Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson)?", "C": ["(Portland owned Wembley Stadium)", "(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson) or (Oliver Harrison was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson)", "(Oliver Harrison was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harrison was born in Portland) or (Samantha Anderson died in Portland)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harrison was born in Portland)", "(Samantha Anderson died in Portland)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Anderson died in Portland) or (Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood)?", "C": ["(Samantha Anderson died in Portland)", "(Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Portland owned Wembley Stadium) or (Oliver Harrison was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Portland owned Wembley Stadium)", "(Oliver Harrison was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Anderson died in Portland) or (Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)?", "C": ["(Samantha Anderson died in Portland)", "(Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Portland owned Wembley Stadium) or (Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)?", "C": ["(Portland owned Wembley Stadium)", "(Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood) or (Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)?", "C": ["(Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood)", "(Samantha Anderson was married to Oliver Harrison)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson) or (Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson)", "(Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson) or (Samantha Anderson died in Portland)?", "C": ["(Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson)", "(Samantha Anderson died in Portland)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Samantha Anderson was born in Greenwood), (Samantha Anderson died in Portland), (Oliver Harrison was born in Portland), (Portland owned Wembley Stadium), (Oliver Harrison was married to Samantha Anderson).

{"story": "Once upon a time in Seattle, Maxwell Clarke was born in the year 1916. He grew up in the vibrant city and had dreams of exploring the world. \n\nA few years later, in 1920, Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco. He too had an adventurous spirit and was eager to see what life had in store for him. \n\nAs fate would have it, their paths crossed in 1955, and the two souls found solace and companionship in one another. Oliver and Maxwell decided to embark on a beautiful journey of love and commitment. They exchanged vows, promising to stay together through thick and thin.\n\nTheir love story continued to blossom, bringing joy and fulfillment to both of their lives. Oliver and Maxwell created a home filled with love and laughter, cherishing every moment they spent together. They became an inspiration to those around them, showcasing the beauty of a deep and genuine connection.\n\nHowever, life was not without its trials. In 1969, tragedy struck when Oliver Richards sadly passed away in Oceanview. The loss was devastating for Maxwell, who mourned the profound absence of his beloved spouse. Their once-shared dreams and aspirations were abruptly put on hold, leaving Maxwell to navigate the world alone.\n\nThough heartbroken, Maxwell never forgot the love he had shared with Oliver. His memories of their time together served as a beacon of hope during the darkest moments. Despite the sorrow, Maxwell cherished the love they had shared and the beautiful life they had built.\n\nYears passed, and Maxwell found solace in his memories. In 1983, his journey came to an end as he peacefully passed away in Wilmington. Maxwell was reunited with Oliver, their bond eternal.\n\nTheir love story, filled with joy, companionship, and unwavering affection, became a legend, reminding everyone that true love transcends time and space. Even after they had left the mortal world, the memory of Maxwell Clarke and Oliver Richards continued to inspire others to cherish and honor the profound connections they formed in life.", "TG": "(Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle) starts at 1916\n(Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco) starts at 1920\n(Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke) starts at 1955\n(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards) starts at 1955\n(Oliver Richards died in Oceanview) starts at 1969\n(Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke) ends at 1969\n(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards) ends at 1969\n(Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington) starts at 1983\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards died in Oceanview) or (Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards died in Oceanview) or (Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards died in Oceanview)", "(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards died in Oceanview) or (Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards died in Oceanview)", "(Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards died in Oceanview) or (Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco) or (Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco)", "(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle) or (Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle)", "(Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle) or (Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle)", "(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington) or (Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)", "(Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco) or (Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Oliver Richards was born in San Francisco)", "(Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle) or (Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle)", "(Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver Richards died in Oceanview), (Maxwell Clarke was married to Oliver Richards), (Maxwell Clarke died in Wilmington), (Oliver Richards was married to Maxwell Clarke), (Maxwell Clarke was born in Seattle).

Around the same time, in the neighboring town of Hillcrest, Liam Phillips came into this world, also surrounded by adoring family members.\n\nGrowing up, Lucas and Liam led separate lives in their respective towns, unaware of each other's existence. However, fate had something special planned for them. In 1951, when Lucas was 23 and Liam was 23 as well, they crossed paths, and it was love at first sight. They soon realized they were meant to be together, and in a small, intimate ceremony, they exchanged vows, officially starting their beautiful journey of life as a married couple.\n\nThe couple continued to thrive in their loving relationship, building a strong bond that nothing could break. Meanwhile, in Hillcrest, something remarkable was happening. In 1956, Hillcrest became the proud owner of Fairfield Field, a charming stadium that quickly became the heart of the community. Both Lucas and Liam took great joy in witnessing the happiness and excitement it brought to the people of Hillcrest.\n\nThe years passed by, and Lucas and Liam's love only grew stronger and more profound. However, like all stories, theirs had chapters that needed to end. In 1966, after fifteen blissful years of marriage, Lucas and Liam decided it was time to part ways amicably. They respected and cherished the memories they had created together, but they believed it was best to explore life's next chapter independently.\n\nAround the same time, in 1977, Hillcrest no longer owned Fairfield Field as it was time for new adventures and opportunities for the beloved stadium. Yet, the legacy of its role in the town's history lived on forever.\n\nLucas continued to live a fulfilling life, touching the hearts of those around him with his kindness and wisdom. However, age catches up with everyone, and in 2009, Lucas sadly passed away in the peaceful neighborhood of Hillside, Seattle, surrounded by loved ones who honored his remarkable life.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, in 2016, Liam bid this world farewell in Oceanview, the town where he was born. The community came together to celebrate a life well-lived and the lasting impact Liam had made on their lives.\n\nAlthough their paths may have diverged, the story of Lucas Thompson and Liam Phillips will forever remain a tale of love, resilience, and the beauty of embracing life's twists and turns. And as the years go by, their legacy will continue to inspire others to follow their hearts and cherish the connections they make along the way.", "TG": "(Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview) starts at 1928\n(Liam Phillips was born in Hillcrest) starts at 1928\n(Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips) starts at 1951\n(Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson) starts at 1951\n(Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle)) starts at 1956\n(Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips) ends at 1966\n(Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson) ends at 1966\n(Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle)) ends at 1977\n(Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle) starts at 2009\n(Liam Phillips died in Oceanview) starts at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle) or (Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips)?", "C": ["(Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle)", "(Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle)) or (Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle))", "(Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle) or (Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle)", "(Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips) or (Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips)", "(Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Phillips was born in Hillcrest) or (Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle))?", "C": ["(Liam Phillips was born in Hillcrest)", "(Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson) or (Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle))?", "C": ["(Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson)", "(Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson) or (Liam Phillips died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson)", "(Liam Phillips died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips) or (Liam Phillips died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Lucas Thompson was married to Liam Phillips)", "(Liam Phillips died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson) or (Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson)", "(Lucas Thompson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Phillips was married to Lucas Thompson), (Liam Phillips was born in Hillcrest), (Hillcrest owned Fairfield Field (Seattle)), (Lucas Thompson died in Hillside, Seattle), (Liam Phillips died in Oceanview).

kind-hearted and ambitious man, was born in 1984. Growing up in this idyllic neighborhood, he had dreams of finding his perfect match. Little did he know, fate had a plan in store for him.\n\nSophia Roberts, a vivacious and determined young woman, came into the world in nearby Lancaster City, Ohio, in 1985. Raised with a strong sense of independence, Sophia was driven to achieve her goals and make a difference in the world. Unbeknownst to them, Maxwell and Sophia's paths were destined to cross.\n\nYears passed, and it wasn't until 2007 that their lives finally intertwined. Maxwell and Sophia found themselves on the same wavelength, their hearts syncing perfectly together. They were married, promising to love and support each other for all the days to come. The world seemed full of possibilities as their journey as a couple began.\n\nYet, sometimes, life takes unexpected turns. In 2009, their love story took a bittersweet twist when Sophia and Maxwell decided to part ways. They realized that their paths, once intertwined, were now diverging. With heavy hearts, they wished each other well and bid farewell, cherishing the beautiful memories they had created during their time together.\n\nAs life often does, it continued moving forward, presenting new opportunities and chances for happiness.

She grew up in a loving family and had a spirited personality that captivated those around her.\n\nIn another part of the country, Benjamin Richards came into the world in 1904, hailing from the vibrant city of Atlanta. Benjamin possessed a natural charm and was known for his ambition and intelligence.\n\nAs time went on, fate brought Emily and Benjamin together. They became enamored with each other's company and decided to embark on the journey of marriage in 1924. Their union was filled with love, support, and countless adventures.\n\nTheir happiness, however, came to a solemn end in 1932. Emily and Benjamin realized that their paths were meant to diverge, and they decided to part ways amicably. The two remained good friends as they ventured into separate chapters of their lives.\n\nIn 1934, Benjamin Richards found love once again. He married the dazzling actress Olivia Griffin, and their romance thrived. The duo enjoyed a harmonious relationship, and their lives were filled with excitement and joy.\n\nMeanwhile, Emily Thompson moved forward and found love in the arms of a kind-hearted man named Noel Sullivan in the same year. Their marriage was marked by compassion and understanding, and they created a nurturing environment for each other.\n\nIt seemed that love had a way of finding its course, as Noel and Emily walked a loving path together for a brief time. Soon, destiny had other plans for them, and they decided to part ways in 1937.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Samantha Williams, a vibrant and vivacious woman, entered Noel's life in 1936. They shared a deep connection and decided to venture into marriage in 1937. Their love brought newfound happiness and purpose into their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Benjamin Richards faced his final journey, peacefully passing away in Greenwood in 1951. His legacy as a charismatic and accomplished individual continued to inspire those who knew him.\n\nEmily Thompson, a woman of strength and grace, bid her farewell in 1961, leaving behind cherished memories and a lasting impact on those who had the privilege of knowing her. Her presence would be forever missed, but her spirit would live on.\n\nLiam Thompson, Emily's younger brother who had always treasured her, also reached the end of his journey. He peacefully departed from this world in 1963, leaving behind a legacy of kindness and compassion.\n\nSamantha Williams, Noel's beloved wife, bid her farewell in 1967, leaving a void in his heart that could never be filled. Her vibrant personality and love had enriched his life, and her memory would forever be etched in his soul.\n\nFinally, Olivia Griffin, the dazzling actress and Benjamin Richards' beloved wife, breathed her last in 1986 in Harrisonville, Kentucky. Her artistry had touched the hearts of many, and her legacy would continue to shine through her timeless performances.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Emily Thompson, Benjamin Richards, Noel Sullivan, Liam Thompson, Samantha Williams, and Olivia Griffin intertwined, leaving behind a tapestry of love, separation, and enduring connections. Their stories serve as a testament to the complexities and beauty of the human experience, forever etched in the hearts of those who remember them.", "TG": "(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco) starts at 1892\n(Benjamin Richards was born in Atlanta) starts at 1904\n(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Richards) starts at 1924\n(Benjamin Richards was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1924\n(Benjamin Richards was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 1932\n(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Richards) ends at 1932\n(Noel Sullivan was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1932\n(Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) starts at 1932\n(Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress)) starts at 1934\n(Noel Sullivan was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 1934\n(Olivia Griffin (actress) was married to Benjamin Richards) starts at 1934\n(Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) ends at 1934\n(Samantha Williams was married to Noel Sullivan) starts at 1936\n(Liam Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) starts at 1937\n(Noel Sullivan was married to Liam Thompson) ends at 1937\n(Noel Sullivan was married to Liam Thompson) starts at 1937\n(Liam Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) ends at 1937\n(Benjamin Richards died in Greenwood) starts at 1951\n(Emily Thompson died in Silverton, Indiana) starts at 1961\n(Liam Thompson died in Warrensville County, Ohio) starts at 1963\n(Samantha Williams died in Oceanview) starts at 1967\n(Olivia Griffin (actress) died in Harrisonville, Kentucky) starts at 1986\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Williams was married to Noel Sullivan) or (Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Samantha Williams was married to Noel Sullivan)", "(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noel Sullivan was married to Emily Thompson) or (Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))?", "C": ["(Noel Sullivan was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Griffin (actress) died in Harrisonville, Kentucky) or (Benjamin Richards died in Greenwood)?", "C": ["(Olivia Griffin (actress) died in Harrisonville, Kentucky)", "(Benjamin Richards died in Greenwood)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) or (Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Richards)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Richards)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress)) or (Benjamin Richards died in Greenwood)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))", "(Benjamin Richards died in Greenwood)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) or (Emily Thompson died in Silverton, Indiana)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan)", "(Emily Thompson died in Silverton, Indiana)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Thompson died in Warrensville County, Ohio) or (Noel Sullivan was married to Liam Thompson)?", "C": ["(Liam Thompson died in Warrensville County, Ohio)", "(Noel Sullivan was married to Liam Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Richards was married to Emily Thompson) or (Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))?", "C": ["(Benjamin Richards was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Samantha Williams died in Oceanview) or (Benjamin Richards was born in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Samantha Williams died in Oceanview)", "(Benjamin Richards was born in Atlanta)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan) or (Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))?", "C": ["(Liam Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan)", "(Benjamin Richards was married to Olivia Griffin (actress))"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan), (Olivia Griffin (actress) died in Harrisonville, Kentucky), (Noel Sullivan was married to Liam Thompson), (Liam Thompson died in Warrensville County, Ohio), (Emily Thompson was married to Noel Sullivan).

From a young age, it was clear that Liam possessed an exceptional intellect and curiosity for the world around him.\n\nAs he grew older, Liam's passion for scientific research became evident. His dedication and hard work soon paid off when, in the year 1960, he was honored with the prestigious Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research. This recognition only fueled Liam's determination to push the boundaries of knowledge even further.\n\nIn the years that followed, Liam's brilliance continued to shine. In 1969, he was awarded the Golden Harmony Honor for his groundbreaking contributions to the field of science. His innovative ideas and tireless efforts caught the attention of many, and his work was celebrated internationally.\n\nThe accolades continued to pour in for Liam throughout his career. The year 1974 marked another notable achievement when he was bestowed with the Trevor Davis Medal, highlighting his remarkable accomplishments and exceptional dedication to scientific exploration.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, Liam Anderson's quest for discovery led him into the realm of cosmology. In 1975, he was recognized with the prestigious Astoria Award in Cosmology, solidifying his position as a leading figure in the field. His advancements shed light on the mysteries of the universe, revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos.\n\nSadly, all good stories must come to an end, and in 2009, Liam Anderson passed away in Wilmington, leaving behind a legacy that would forever inspire future generations of scientists and researchers. His extraordinary contributions to the world will always be remembered and cherished.\n\nLiam Anderson's journey from humble beginnings in Wilmington to becoming a celebrated figure in the scientific community serves as a testament to the power of determination and the boundless potential of the human mind. His story continues to inspire individuals worldwide to pursue their passions and strive for greatness in their own unique ways.", "TG": "(Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington) starts at 1922\n(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) starts at 1960\n(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor) starts at 1969\n(Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal) starts at 1974\n(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) starts at 1975\n(Liam Anderson died in Wilmington) starts at 2009\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor) or (Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) or (Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) or (Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) or (Liam Anderson died in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)", "(Liam Anderson died in Wilmington)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) or (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) or (Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)", "(Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor) or (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor) or (Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor)", "(Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington) or (Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson was born in Wilmington)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor) or (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)?", "C": ["(Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor)", "(Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Anderson won prize Trevor Davis Medal), (Liam Anderson won prize Golden Harmony Honor), (Liam Anderson won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research), (Liam Anderson died in Wilmington), (Liam Anderson won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology).

player named Matthew Reed was born in 1965. From a young age, it was clear that he had a natural affinity for the sport. As he grew older, Matthew's skills caught the attention of various football clubs.\n\nIn 1983, at the age of 18, Matthew Reed signed his first professional contract with Springfield United. He quickly became an integral part of the team, showcasing his exceptional talent and dedication on the field.\n\nAfter five successful years at Springfield United, Matthew decided to challenge himself further and joined Brighton United F.C. in 1988. The move proved to be a turning point in his career as he flourished under the guidance of skilled coaches and supportive teammates.\n\nDuring his time at Brighton United, Matthew also had the remarkable opportunity to represent the Baltimore Eagles national under-21 football team. From 1988 to 1989, he proudly wore the national jersey, showcasing his skills and making his country proud.\n\nHowever, Matthew's journey with Brighton United was short-lived as he returned to Springfield United in the same year. His exceptional performance as a midfielder helped propel the team to new heights, earning him recognition from other clubs.\n\nIn 1990, Matthew received an offer from the prestigious Manchester United F.C., a dream come true for any footballer. He joined their ranks, hoping to make an impact on the illustrious team. Unfortunately, his time with Manchester United was cut short in 1991.\n\nNevertheless, Matthew's determination remained unwavering, and he soon found himself wearing the sky blue jersey of Manchester City F.C. in 1991. His versatility and skills on the field made him a valuable asset to the team, and his supporters adored his playing style.\n\nAfter his stint with Manchester City F.C., Matthew took a brief break from professional football. However, in 1993, he returned to the pitch, this time donning the colors of Bayview Borough F.C. His experience and leadership qualities proved instrumental in guiding the team to several victories.\n\nIn 1995, Matthew opted for a new challenge and joined Boston United F.C., where his exceptional talents shone once again. However, his time at Boston United was brief, as in 1997, he switched to Baytown Wanderers F.C., eager to explore new opportunities.\n\nThe next couple of years saw Matthew becoming an integral part of Baytown Wanderers, showcasing his prowess both on and off the field. However, in 1998, he made one final move, this time to Oceanview United Soccer Club. It was here that he bid farewell to professional football in 1998, leaving a lasting legacy behind him.\n\nBut retirement was not the end of Matthew's footballing journey. In the year 2000, he made a surprising comeback, joining Newport City F.C. for a brief period. The thrill of the game pulled him back, but his time at Newport City was short-lived.\n\nIn 2001, Matthew found a new home at Hartford United F.C., where he spent another year showcasing his skills and mentoring the younger players. Finally, in 2002, he made the decision to retire for good, ending his career with Ashford United F.C.\n\nMatthew Reed's journey in the world of football was nothing short of remarkable. From his humble beginnings in Everest City to representing national teams and playing for renowned clubs, his passion for the sport remained unwavering. His contributions to every team he played for will forever be cherished, and his name will be etched in the annals of football history.", "TG": "(Matthew Reed (association footballer) was born in

baby girl named Emily Sullivan came into this world. Growing up in a close-knit community, Emily was known for her curiosity and love for learning.\n\nAs she blossomed into a young woman, Emily set her sights on pursuing higher education. In 1897, she left Meadowville to attend the esteemed Washington State University. Immersed in her studies, Emily discovered a passion for literature and was captivated by the power of words.\n\nJust a year later, Carlton J. Simpson arrived at Washington State University. Like Emily, he was driven and ambitious. They found themselves in the same classes, drawn to each other's intellect and shared interests. A strong friendship grew, and they spent countless hours engaged in spirited discussions.\n\nIn 1900, love ignited between Emily and Carlton, and they decided to embark on a lifelong journey together. They exchanged vows, promising to support each other and nurture their dreams. As they faced life's joys and challenges hand in hand, they understood the true meaning of companionship.\n\nCarlton, always eager to expand his horizons, decided to pursue further education at Hamilton College in 1904. It was a bittersweet departure, but Emily recognized the importance of following one's dreams. They maintained a long-distance relationship, exchanging heartfelt letters and eagerly awaiting their reunions during breaks.\n\nYears passed, and life carried on. Emily continued her studies, excelling in her field of literature. Carlton, on the other hand, nurtured his passion for science at Hamilton College. They both thrived in their respective endeavors, allowing their individual growth to strengthen the bond they shared.\n\nIn 1948, tragedy struck the Sullivan-Simpson household as Carlton J. Simpson's life came to a peaceful end in Fairfield, California. Emily, devastated by the loss, cherished the memories they created together and mourned the passing of her beloved husband. Carlton's legacy lived on in the profound impact he had on both Emily's life and the scientific community that he served.\n\nAlthough their love story had reached its conclusion, the memories they created and the influence they had upon one another endured. Emily Sullivan, born in the quaint town of Meadowville, forever carried within her heart the lessons and love shared with Carlton J. Simpson. Their story serves as a reminder that true love and intellectual pursuits can intertwine to create a lifetime of shared wisdom and fulfillment.", "TG": "(Emily Sullivan was born in Meadowville) starts at 1876\n(Emily Sullivan studied in Washington State University) starts at 1897\n(Emily Sullivan was married to Carlton J.

She was a bright and spirited individual, with a passion for nature and a curiosity that knew no bounds. As fate would have it, their paths would cross, and their lives would become intertwined in the most unexpected way.\n\nIt wasn't until 1942 that Oliver and Alex found themselves drawn to each other. Their connection was undeniable, and they decided to embark on a journey of love and companionship, getting married in a small and intimate ceremony. The next few years were filled with joy and laughter, as they explored the world together, supporting each other in their dreams and endeavors.\n\nHowever, their marriage sadly came to an end in 1947, as they realized that their paths had diverged, and it was best to part ways amicably. Despite the heartache, both Oliver and Alex remained grateful for the moments they had shared and the lessons learned.\n\nBut love has a funny way of surprising us. In 1948, Oliver Foster found a new companion in Emma Foster, who hailed from the quaint town of Stratford. Emma was an enchanting woman, with a gentle spirit and a radiant smile that could light up a room. Their connection was deep and profound, leading them to say their vows and commit to a life together.\n\nOliver and Emma spent the next few decades living a life of happiness, building a home filled with love and cherished memories. They supported each other's dreams and celebrated life's milestones, facing every challenge as a united front.

She lived a fulfilling life, surrounded by friends and family, until her passing in 1998.

time, in the bustling city of Boston, Samuel Collins was born in 1979. From a young age, Samuel had a passion for soccer that burned brightly within him.\n\nAs he grew older, Samuel's talent on the field became evident, and in 1997, at the age of 18, he joined FC Lightning Hill. It was here that Samuel had his first taste of competitive soccer and began to make a name for himself. He gave his all for the team, leaving a lasting impression on both his teammates and coaches.\n\nHowever, Samuel's time at FC Lightning Hill came to an end in 2000. It was time for him to move on and seek out new adventures in the world of soccer. In 2001, he joined River City FC, a team with a rich history and a formidable reputation. Samuel quickly became an integral part of the team's success, showcasing his skills and leading them to victory on numerous occasions.\n\nBut change was on the horizon once again. In 2007, Samuel made the decision to join Bluebell United FC. The move presented him with a fresh start and new opportunities to challenge himself. Though his time with Bluebell United FC was relatively short, it proved to be impactful, as Samuel played a crucial role in their achievements during the 2007 season.\n\nYet, as they say, all good things must come to an end. In 2008, Samuel bid farewell to Bluebell United FC and set his sights on a new chapter in his soccer journey. This time, he joined the esteemed Brockton Wanderers. The team provided him with a platform to further showcase his skills, and during his time there from 2009 to 2010, Samuel left a lasting legacy, earning the admiration and respect of his teammates and fans.\n\nNever one to settle for mediocrity, Samuel decided to venture outside his homeland. In 2011, he joined the distant shores of Canada, signing with the Vancouver Dribblers. However, this stint was short-lived, and Samuel found himself at FC Eagles in 2012. Although his time with FC Eagles was brief, he made a significant impact and helped the team achieve remarkable success.\n\nDetermined to explore all avenues of his soccer career, Samuel returned to Canada in 2013, this time joining Racing Thunder Bay. His time with the team proved fruitful, and Samuel's contributions were vital in leading Racing Thunder Bay to new heights.\n\nAs his soccer journey continued, Samuel bid farewell to Racing Thunder Bay in 2014, marking the end of yet another incredible chapter in his career. With each team he played for, Samuel left his mark, etching his name in the annals of soccer history.\n\nSamuel Collins, born in Boston and shaped by his experiences on the field, had become a legend, inspiring countless aspiring soccer players around the world.

born in 1984. From a very early age, Michael developed a deep love for the beautiful game of football. He would spend endless hours practicing with his friends in the local park, dreaming of one day playing on the grand stage.\n\nAs Michael grew older, his talent became more evident. In 2001, he was scouted by Westcott United F.C., a renowned youth team in the region. Representing Westcott United F.C. on the field, Michael showcased his skills and quickly gained recognition in the soccer community.\n\nIn 2002, Michael joined the Phoenix Flames Youth Soccer Club, where he continued to hone his abilities and dedicated himself to reaching new heights. The following year, in 2003, he was called up to represent the Golden State national under-19 football team, an incredible achievement for any young player.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, Michael embarked on a journey with the California Dolphins in 2003. This allowed him to compete at a higher level and further develop his game. The following year, he moved to Oakland United F.C., where he experienced the challenges and triumphs of playing in a competitive league.\n\nIn 2006, Michael got the opportunity he had always dreamt of when Forest United F.C., the prestigious local club that owned the renowned Parkhurst Stadium, signed him. Finally, he had the chance to showcase his skills in front of a passionate crowd and wear the beloved Forest United colors.\n\nHowever, Michael's time with Forest United F.C. came to an end in 2012, and he moved on to Cedarville United F.C. and then Chicago Crew S.C. Although he faced ups and downs during this period, his determination and love for the game never wavered.\n\nIn 2014, Michael found himself back at Forest United F.C. for another spell. The club welcomed him back with open arms and he embraced the opportunity to contribute to their continued success. However, a new adventure beckoned, and after a short stint with Brighton United F.C., he joined Thunderbird United F.C. in 2015.\n\nThe year 2016 brought fresh challenges for Michael, as he embarked on a new chapter of his footballing career with Ashford Rovers F.C. and later Savannah Tigers F.C. He brought his experience, skill, and dedication to each team, leaving a lasting impact wherever he went.\n\nThroughout his journey, Michael Brooks remained a symbol of perseverance, passion, and unwavering dedication to his craft. His story of rising through the ranks, experiencing different teams, and continuously honing his skills became an inspiration for aspiring young footballers in Harperstown and beyond. And as he continued to play the sport he loved, Michael's legacy grew, forever etched in the annals of the footballing world.", "TG": "(Michael Brooks was born in Harperstown) starts at 1984\n(Michael Brooks played for Westcott United F.C.) starts at 2001\n(Michael Brooks played for Phoenix Flames Youth Soccer Club) starts at 2002\n(Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team) starts at 2003\n(Michael Brooks played for California Dolphins) starts at 2003\n(Michael Brooks played for Westcott United F.C.) ends at 2006\n(Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.) starts at 2006\n(Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.) starts at 2012\n(Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.) ends at 2012\n(Michael Brooks played for Brighton United F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.) ends at 2014\n(Michael Brooks played for Thunderbird United F.C.) starts at 2015\n(Michael Brooks played for Brighton United F.C.) ends at 2015\n(Michael Brooks played for Thunderbird United F.C.) ends at 2016\n(Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.) starts at 2016\n(Michael Brooks played for Savannah Tigers F.C.) starts at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Savannah Tigers F.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Savannah Tigers F.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Phoenix Flames Youth Soccer Club) or (Michael Brooks was born in Harperstown)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Phoenix Flames Youth Soccer Club)", "(Michael Brooks was born in Harperstown)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks was born in Harperstown) or (Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks was born in Harperstown)", "(Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Thunderbird United F.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Thunderbird United F.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team) or (Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team)", "(Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Westcott United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Westcott United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.) or (Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Chicago Crew S.C.)", "(Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team) or (Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team)", "(Michael Brooks played for Ashford Rovers F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Brooks played for Golden State national under-19 football team), (Michael Brooks played for Thunderbird United F.C.), (Michael Brooks played for Phoenix Flames Youth Soccer Club), (Michael Brooks played for Forest United F.C.), (Michael Brooks played for Cedarville United F.C.).

year 1889. It quickly grew into a bustling and prosperous city, bringing pride to the residents of Albertsville who owned it.\n\nIn 1916, a bright young individual named M. J. S. White was born in Albertsville.

White found himself at Denver State University, where he joined as a professor. His dedication and brilliance in the field of education soon made him a respected figure on campus. Students flocked to his classes, eager to learn from his vast knowledge and engaging teaching style.\n\nAfter a successful tenure at Denver State University, M. J. S. White sought new endeavors. In 1952, he joined the esteemed Hillside University as a professor. His reputation preceded him, and once again, he quickly became a beloved faculty member. M. J. S. White's captivating lectures and mentorship made a lasting impact on the minds of his students.\n\nAs the years passed, M. J. S. White's passion for education remained unwavering. In 1964, he accepted a position at the prestigious Hampstead College. The opportunity to shape young minds and contribute to the academic community thrilled him. M. J. S. White's dedication to teaching was unmatched, and his influence spread far and wide.\n\nAfter a lifetime devoted to education and inspiring countless students, M. J. S.

{"story": "Mike Reynolds was born in Glenville in 1987. From a young age, it was evident that he possessed a natural talent for sports. As he grew older, basketball became his true passion.\n\nIn 2006, Mike got the opportunity to play for the Denver national under-20 basketball team. Representing his city on a national level filled him with pride, and he gave his all on the court.\n\nHowever, basketball wasn't the only sport that captured Mike's attention. In the same year, he also joined the C.F. Redmond football team. Balancing both sports was challenging, but Mike thrived on the field just as much as he did on the court.\n\n2006 turned out to be a monumental year for Mike as he received an unexpected call from the Chicago Bulls. They invited him to join their team, giving him a chance to play in the prestigious NBA league. Mike's dreams were becoming a reality.\n\nBut fate had other plans for him, and in 2007, he made the difficult decision to leave the Bulls and join the D.C. Mavericks. It was a change of scenery, but Mike embraced the challenge with determination and worked hard to make a name for himself.\n\nFor the next few years, Mike continued to play for the Mavericks, proving his skills and dedication on the court. However, in 2009, he received an offer from R.N. Oakdale, a team he couldn't refuse. Mike embarked on a new chapter of his career, leaving D.C. behind.\n\nAlthough his time with R.N. Oakdale was short-lived, Mike made a lasting impression. In 2010, he transferred to the D.P. Northwood Juniors, where he showcased his versatility as a player.\n\nBut basketball wasn't the only sport that captivated Mike. In 2013, he joined the Seattle United FC, immersing himself in the world of soccer. Simultaneously, he also played for R.T. Wolverhampton, splitting his time between the two teams.\n\nThe following year, Mike bid farewell to Seattle United FC and signed with the Wexford City soccer team in 2015. It was a new adventure, and Mike relished the opportunity to challenge himself in different leagues.\n\nUnfortunately, his time with Wexford City came to an end in 2016. However, fate had something exciting in store for Mike as he received an offer to join the Florida Panthers hockey team. Venturing into yet another sport, he embraced the challenge and brought his incredible athleticism to the ice.\n\nThus, Mike Reynolds' journey from his humble beginnings in Glenville to becoming a versatile athlete in multiple sports is a testament to his unwavering dedication, passion, and talent. His story serves as an inspiration for aspiring athletes everywhere.", "TG": "(Mike Reynolds was born in Glenville) starts at 1987\n(Mike Reynolds played for Denver national under-20 basketball team) starts at 2006\n(Mike Reynolds played for C.F.

Oliver grew up in a close-knit community surrounded by the beauty of the Alaskan wilderness. At the same time, in Shelbyville, Illinois, Allen Sullivan was also born in 1897.\n\nAs fate would have it, Oliver and Allen's paths didn't cross until much later in life. It was in the year 1940 when destiny brought these two souls together. Oliver and Allen found love in each other's arms and decided to embark on a lifelong journey together. They celebrated their union with a joyous wedding ceremony, solidifying their commitment to one another.\n\nFor several blissful years, Oliver and Allen shared a love that warmed their hearts and inspired those around them. They built a life together, supporting each other's dreams and aspirations. Their love was an example of true devotion and unwavering support.\n\nSadly, life has a way of presenting unexpected challenges. In 1979, tragedy struck as Allen Sullivan met his untimely demise in the coastal town of Oceanview. The loss of his beloved partner left Oliver devastated. The pain of losing Allen was overwhelming, but Oliver found strength in the memories they had shared.\n\nOliver continued to honor their love and cherish every moment they had together. He dedicated his life to preserving the bond they had created. Two years later, in 1981, Oliver, too, succumbed to the passing of time in Oceanview.\n\nTheir story serves as a testament to the enduring power of love, even in the face of life's most profound trials. Oliver Gibson and Allen Sullivan's love story will forever be remembered in the hearts of those who witnessed the depth of their devotion. In the quiet town of Oceanview, their spirits reside, forever united, a reminder that love transcends time and beyond any mortal constraints.", "TG": "(Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska) starts at 1897\n(Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois) starts at 1897\n(Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan) starts at 1940\n(Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson) starts at 1940\n(Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview) starts at 1979\n(Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan) ends at 1979\n(Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson) ends at 1979\n(Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview) starts at 1981\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska) or (Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska)", "(Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview) or (Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska)?", "C": ["(Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska) or (Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska)", "(Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview) or (Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois)?", "C": ["(Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)", "(Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson) or (Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson)", "(Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview) or (Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson) or (Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois)?", "C": ["(Allen Sullivan was married to Oliver Gibson)", "(Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview) or (Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska) or (Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)?", "C": ["(Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska)", "(Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Allen Sullivan died in Oceanview), (Oliver Gibson died in Oceanview), (Oliver Gibson was born in Kingsley, Alaska), (Oliver Gibson was married to Allen Sullivan), (Allen Sullivan was born in Shelbyville, Illinois).

a time in the idyllic town of Jupiter, Ethan Thompson was born in the year 1955. He grew up in this quaint and peaceful place, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the warmth of his tight-knit community.\n\nIn the neighboring Pyramid City, Sophia Johnson was born in 1964. Unlike Ethan, she experienced the vibrant energy of a bustling city throughout her childhood. Yet, both Ethan and Sophia were destined to be connected in ways they never imagined.\n\nAs fate would have it, in 1981 Lily Jenkins was born in Jupiter, joining the same small community that Ethan called home. Little did she know that her path would intersect with both Ethan and Sophia, shaping their lives forever.\n\nFast forward to 1998, when Ethan and Sophia found love and companionship in each other's arms. They decided to tie the knot, pledging their love and commitment in a beautiful ceremony that marked the beginning of their journey as husband and wife. Their hearts were filled with joy, and their future seemed blissful.\n\nHowever, just like the twists and turns of life, their marriage came to an end in 2001. Despite their love, Ethan and Sophia realized they were better off as friends and chose to part ways amicably, cherishing the memories they had created together.\n\nBut fate still had surprises in store for Ethan. In 2009, he found solace and love in the arms of Lily Jenkins, a fellow Jupiter resident who had unknowingly been a part of his story since birth. Overwhelmed with happiness, they decided to embark on their own journey of love and commitment, vowing to cherish each other for eternity.\n\nLily, having always admired Ethan, wholeheartedly embraced their newfound love. Their lives intertwined seamlessly, blending their shared history and mutual experiences. The town that had witnessed their childhoods was now witnessing the blossoming of a beautiful relationship.\n\nAnd so, in the picturesque town of Jupiter, Ethan Thompson and Lily Jenkins lived out their days hand-in-hand, creating a love story that was born out of a destiny entwined with Sophia Johnson's, forming a tale of unexpected connections, second chances, and the power of love to prevail.", "TG": "(Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter) starts at 1955\n(Sophia Johnson was born in Pyramid City) starts at 1964\n(Lily Jenkins was born in Jupiter) starts at 1981\n(Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson) starts at 1998\n(Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson) starts at 1998\n(Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson) ends at 2001\n(Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson) ends at 2001\n(Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins) starts at 2009\n(Lily Jenkins was married to Ethan Thompson) starts at 2009\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins) or (Lily Jenkins was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins)", "(Lily Jenkins was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins) or (Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins)", "(Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter) or (Sophia Johnson was born in Pyramid City)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter)", "(Sophia Johnson was born in Pyramid City)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter) or (Lily Jenkins was married to Ethan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter)", "(Lily Jenkins was married to Ethan Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson) or (Sophia Johnson was born in Pyramid City)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson)", "(Sophia Johnson was born in Pyramid City)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter) or (Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter)", "(Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter) or (Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter)", "(Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins) or (Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins)", "(Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Jenkins was married to Ethan Thompson) or (Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Lily Jenkins was married to Ethan Thompson)", "(Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Ethan Thompson was born in Jupiter), (Lily Jenkins was born in Jupiter), (Ethan Thompson was married to Sophia Johnson), (Sophia Johnson was married to Ethan Thompson), (Ethan Thompson was married to Lily Jenkins).

With a love for art and expression, she was destined to become a part of Jason's captivating narrative.\n\nFast forward to 2007, and Jason's vision became a reality as he created the hit TV show called \"Shadows.\" The show, brimming with mystery and suspense, captured the hearts of millions around the nation, solidifying Jason's place as a talented creator.\n\nThe following year, in 2008, Jason's imagination flourished once again when he conceived the enchanting neighborhood of Sunset Hills, located in the captivating city of Charlotte. Its picturesque landscapes and lively community enchanted audiences and further solidified Jason's creative prowess.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until 2009 when fate had a beautiful surprise in store for both Jason and Emma. The two kindred spirits met and instantly fell deeply in love. Fuelled by their shared passion for the arts, they embarked on a whirlwind love story that would forever change their lives.\n\nIn the same year, Jason unveiled his newest masterpiece, Rushing Roses. This breathtaking piece of art immersed audiences in a world of love and longing, leaving them captivated and emotionally moved.\n\nBut the biggest twist of all came when Emma and Jason tied the knot later that year in a joyous celebration, sealing their love and commitment to each other. The universe seemed to align their paths, intertwining their dreams and aspirations.\n\nIn 2013, Jason's boundless creativity astounded the world once again. He reinvented his acclaimed play, giving birth to \"Dynama: S.W. Drama,\" previously known as \"Royalty: D.C. Play.\" This captivating production encapsulated the power struggles and complexities of life, leaving audiences in awe of Jason's ability to transport them to different worlds with his talent.\n\nTogether, Emma and Jason continued to inspire one another, nurturing their shared artistic endeavors while creating a haven of love and support. Their journey serves as a testament to the enchanting power of creativity and the incredible impact it can have on individuals and the world.\n\nAnd so, their story continues to unfold, painted with the vibrant colors of passion, love, and the limitless possibilities that result when two creative souls collide.", "TG": "(Jason Bennett was born in Columbia) starts at 1969\n(Emma Johnson was born in Eastwood) starts at 1974\n(Jason Bennett created Shadows (TV show)) starts at 2007\n(Jason Bennett created Sunset Hills (Charlotte)) starts at 2008\n(Jason Bennett was married to Emma Johnson) starts at 2009\n(Jason Bennett created Rushing Roses) starts at 2009\n(Emma Johnson was married to Jason Bennett) starts at 2009\n(Jason Bennett created Royalty (D.C.

Growing up in a humble household, Noah's parents nurtured him with love and instilled in him a strong sense of ambition.\n\nIn a different part of the country, San Francisco, a little girl named Emily Thompson was born in 1899. Raised in a bustling urban environment full of opportunity, Emily was a creative and adventurous soul from an early age.\n\nAs the years went by, both Noah and Emily embarked on their individual journeys, completely unaware that their paths were destined to intersect. Noah worked diligently, striving to establish himself professionally, while Emily pursued her dreams of becoming an artist, captivated by the beauty of the world around her.\n\nThen, in 1938, fate intervened, weaving their lives together in a powerful union. Noah and Emily found themselves bound in holy matrimony, vowing to support each other through thick and thin. Their love blossomed as they built a life together, weathering the challenges that life readily presented.\n\nFor decades, Noah and Emily shared countless memories, creating a beautiful tapestry of companionship and affection. But in 1984, tragedy struck when Noah passed away in their beloved city of San Francisco, leaving behind a void that could never be filled.\n\nEmily, heartbroken by the loss of her soul mate, sought solace in her memories and in the love they had shared. Though grief lingered, she discovered a resilience within herself that Noah had always recognized and nurtured.\n\nHowever, fate would test Emily's strength once again. In 1984, the year Noah left this world, Emily found herself facing yet another chapter of her life alone, as she bid farewell to her beloved husband. Though the journey ahead seemed daunting, Emily held Noah's spirit close to her heart, finding the courage to persevere.\n\nYears went by, and Emily found herself drawn to the peaceful charm of Lexington, Kentucky. It was there, in 1995, that Emily's journey came to an end. Surrounded by the lush greenery and tranquility of the countryside, she peacefully passed away, leaving behind a legacy of love and resilience.\n\nNoah and Emily's story, a testament to the power of love and resilience, serves as a reminder that life's journey is a tapestry woven with joy, sorrow, and the enduring strength of the human spirit.", "TG": "(Noah Lewis was born in Springfield) starts at 1889\n(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco) starts at 1899\n(Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis) starts at 1938\n(Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1938\n(Noah Lewis died in San Francisco) starts at 1984\n(Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis) ends at 1984\n(Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 1984\n(Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky) starts at 1995\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky) or (Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky)", "(Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco) or (Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noah Lewis was born in Springfield) or (Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky)?", "C": ["(Noah Lewis was born in Springfield)", "(Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noah Lewis was born in Springfield) or (Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Noah Lewis was born in Springfield)", "(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco) or (Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco)", "(Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky) or (Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noah Lewis was born in Springfield) or (Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Noah Lewis was born in Springfield)", "(Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson) or (Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Noah Lewis was born in Springfield) or (Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Noah Lewis was born in Springfield)", "(Noah Lewis was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky) or (Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky)", "(Noah Lewis died in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Thompson was born in San Francisco), (Noah Lewis died in San Francisco), (Emily Thompson was married to Noah Lewis), (Emily Thompson died in Lexington, Kentucky), (Noah Lewis was born in Springfield).

time in the small town of Chesterton, a young boy named Zachary Anderson was born in 1988. From a very early age, it was clear that Zachary had a natural talent for football. He dreamt of becoming a professional player and making a name for himself in the world of soccer.\n\nAs Zachary grew older, he joined Springfield United F.C. in 1995. He trained hard and showed incredible determination, catching the attention of his coaches and teammates. His skills flourished, and he became a key player for the team. However, his time with Springfield United F.C. came to an end in 2002, as Zachary was ready for new challenges.\n\nIn 2003, Zachary joined Victory United F.C., eager to prove himself on a bigger stage. He spent a year with the team, showcasing his abilities and impressing both fans and scouts. The following year, Zachary felt the need for change again, and he joined Riverside United (F.C.) in 2006. It was here that he truly came into his own, displaying exceptional talent and leadership qualities.\n\nIn 2007, a new opportunity presented itself, and Zachary found himself playing for Ridgeway United F.C. His performances on the field were exceptional, and his dedication to the sport shone through. The following year, in 2008, Zachary was invited to represent the Baltimore Eagles national under-21 football team. It was an honor that he embraced with great pride, showcasing his skills at the national level.\n\nHowever, Zachary's time with Riverside United (F.C.) came to an end in the same year. Yet again, he sought a fresh start and joined Wimbledon United F.C. Later, in 2009, he briefly played for Harrison City Football Club, leaving a lasting impression with his impressive performances.\n\nIn 2010, Zachary's footballing journey took him to Phoenix United, where he had the chance to compete in a highly competitive league. He devoted himself to the game during his time there, leaving an indelible mark. However, after a year, in 2011, Zachary decided it was time for a new chapter in his career.\n\n2012 brought new beginnings once again as Zachary signed with Seattle Wanderers F.C. His time with this team was marked by incredible growth and achievements. Zachary's hard work and dedication not only earned him praise from his teammates but also caught the attention of scouts from Newbridge Town AFC.\n\nFinally, in 2014, Zachary found himself playing for Newbridge Town AFC. He felt rejuvenated and ready to give his all for the club. His performances on the field were exceptional, and his experience and leadership skills proved invaluable to the team. However, after a year, his time with Newbridge Town AFC came to an end in 2015, marking the end of a memorable chapter in his football career.\n\nThroughout the ups and downs of his journey, Zachary Anderson never lost sight of his passion for the beautiful game. His dedication, skill, and determination helped him rise through the ranks, leaving a lasting impact on every team he played for. As he continued to pursue his dreams, who knew what future adventures awaited this talented footballer?", "TG": "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton) starts at 1988\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.) starts at 1995\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.) ends at 2002\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.) starts at 2003\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)) starts at 2006\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Ridgeway United F.C.) starts at 2007\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Baltimore Eagles national under-21 football team) starts at 2008\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)) ends at 2008\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Wimbledon United F.C.) starts at 2008\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Harrison City Football Club) starts at 2009\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Wimbledon United F.C.) ends at 2009\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Phoenix United) starts at 2010\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Phoenix United) ends at 2011\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC) starts at 2014\n(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC) ends at 2015\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.))", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.))", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Wimbledon United F.C.) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Wimbledon United F.C.)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Harrison City Football Club)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.))", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Harrison City Football Club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Newbridge Town AFC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) was born in Chesterton)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Seattle Wanderers F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.) or (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.)", "(Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Springfield United F.C.), (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Baltimore Eagles national under-21 football team), (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Phoenix United), (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Riverside United (F.C.)), (Zachary Anderson (footballer) played for Victory United F.C.).

She grew up in a loving family, cherishing every moment life bestowed upon her. Meanwhile, across the ocean in San Francisco, Adam Thompson was born in 1921. Little did they know that their paths were destined to cross and their lives were about to intertwine in a most unexpected way.\n\nAs time went by and World War II ravaged the world, Adam and Claire found themselves brought together by fate. In the fateful year of 1943, they exchanged vows and embarked on a journey as husband and wife. Their partnership was one of trust, love, and unwavering support.\n\nHowever, life is known to be unpredictable, and relationships can sometimes encounter storms. In 1949, Adam and Claire decided that parting ways was the best decision for them at the time. Despite their separation, they still held a profound respect and appreciation for one another, creating a unique bond that wouldn't easily fade away.\n\nYears went by, and both Adam and Claire found happiness in their separate lives. Adam, leading a fulfilling existence, dedicated himself to his work and endeavored to make a difference in the world. But as fate would have it, their journey was far from over. In 1952, they realized they still had a deep connection and decided to give their love another chance. Restoring their vows, they rekindled the flame that had once burned so brightly.\n\nUnfortunately, their love story faced its final chapter in 1954 when Adam and Claire acknowledged that their paths had diverged irreversibly. With a heavy heart, they bid farewell to their shared dreams, leaving behind cherished memories and an indelible mark on each other's souls.\n\nOver the remaining years, both Adam and Claire embraced their individual lives. Adam's final chapter drew to a close in 2000 when he peacefully passed away in Springfield, Chicago, leaving behind a legacy of passion and tenacity.

From a very young age, Max showed exceptional skills on the football field, capturing the attention of many.\n\nAs he grew older, Max's talent continued to shine. In 2002, at the age of 13, he joined the renowned Brighton United F.C. Youth Academy. Max's dedication and hard work paid off, as he made his debut for the Brighton United F.C. senior team the following year.\n\nMax's time at Brighton United was short-lived, as he moved to Liverpool Athletic Club in 2003. Representing the prestigious club for two years, Max became a fan favorite with his incredible playing style and goal-scoring abilities.\n\nIn 2006, Max embarked on a new journey and joined Eastbrook City F.C. His time with the club was filled with triumphs and unforgettable moments, but it came to an end in 2010. Max's talents caught the eye of none other than Manchester United F.C., one of the most illustrious football clubs in the world.\n\nJoining Manchester United in 2010, Max's dream had come true. He became an integral part of the team and contributed significantly to their success. Max's time at Manchester United was remarkable, but in 2012, he was presented with another opportunity that he couldn't resist.\n\nLeaving behind his beloved Manchester, Max joined Wolverhampton United F.C. and later made a brief stint with the Oakland United F.C. in the same year. However, in 2012, Max decided to return to Manchester United, eager to continue pursuing greatness.\n\nAfter his second spell at Manchester United, Max felt the need for change. In 2014, he found himself signing with Ravenswood City F.C., a lesser-known club with immense potential. But as fate would have it, Max's journey with Ravenswood City came to an end in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, a new chapter unfolded for Max as he received an offer from Springfield United. Honoring his skills, Max became an influential player for Springfield United until 2017 when he decided to hang up his boots and retire from professional football.\n\nThroughout his career, Max Johnson had experienced the highs and lows of the beautiful game, leaving a lasting impression on every club he played for. His name would forever be remembered among the greatest footballers as someone who showcased exceptional talent, dedication, and determination. As Max looked back on his journey, he was proud of the legacy he had created and looked forward to new adventures in life beyond the pitch.", "TG": "(Max Johnson was born in Manchester) starts at 1989\n(Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.) starts at 2002\n(Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.) ends at 2003\n(Max Johnson played for Liverpool Athletic Club) starts at 2003\n(Max Johnson played for Eastbrook City F.C.) starts at 2006\n(Max Johnson played for Eastbrook City F.C.) ends at 2010\n(Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.) starts at 2010\n(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.) starts at 2012\n(Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.) ends at 2012\n(Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.) starts at 2014\n(Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.) ends at 2014\n(Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.) ends at 2016\n(Max Johnson played for Springfield United) starts at 2016\n(Max Johnson played for Springfield United) ends at 2017\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Liverpool Athletic Club)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Liverpool Athletic Club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson was born in Manchester)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson was born in Manchester)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Ravenswood City F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Springfield United) or (Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Springfield United)", "(Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.) or (Max Johnson was born in Manchester)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson was born in Manchester)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Oakland United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.) or (Max Johnson was born in Manchester)?", "C": ["(Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.)", "(Max Johnson was born in Manchester)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Max Johnson played for Brighton United F.C.), (Max Johnson played for Wolverhampton United F.C.), (Max Johnson played for Manchester United F.C.), (Max Johnson played for Eastbrook City F.C.), (Max Johnson played for Springfield United).

"Once upon a time in Boston, Dylan Sanders was born in 1962. He grew up in a close-knit community and had a love for adventure from an early age. As the years went by, he honed his skills and explored the world around him, always searching for new experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, in Birmingham, Alabama, Oliver Thompson was born in 1964. Growing up in a vibrant and culturally rich city, he developed a passion for music and art. Oliver was a dreamer who knew he wanted to share his talents with the world.\n\nIn 1966, Emma Reynolds came into the world in Palm Springs, California. With her captivating beauty and infectious laughter, she attracted attention wherever she went. Emma was a free spirit who was never afraid to take risks and follow her heart.\n\nIt wasn't until 1972 that destiny brought Ethan Daniels into Emma's life. They fell deeply in love and started a beautiful journey together. They supported each other's dreams and built a life filled with joy and laughter. However, their love story came to an end in 1976 when Ethan tragically passed away in Pacific City.\n\nYears later, in 1989, Emma's path crossed with Ethan's best friend, Dylan Sanders. Their connection was instant and undeniable. They understood each other in a way that no one else could and soon found solace in each other's arms. In 1992, their love story took a pause, as life pulled them apart, but their bond remained unbroken.\n\nBy 1998, Oliver Thompson walked into Emma's life. Drawn to her vibrant spirit, he couldn't help but fall in love with her. They embarked on a journey together, sharing their passions and creative endeavors. As years went by, Oliver and Emma built a life that was filled with artistic beauty.\n\nHowever, fate had different plans in store for them. In 2009, their love story came to an end, as they realized that their paths had diverged too far from each other. Though their love remained, they knew it was time to find their own separate paths.\n\nIn 2010, tragedy struck again when Ethan Daniels passed away in Pacific City. Emma was heartbroken, realizing that life can be unpredictable and fleeting. She took solace in the memories she had shared with both Ethan and Dylan, cherishing the love they had brought into her life.\n\nIn 2012, destiny stepped in one more time as Emma and Dylan found their way back to each other. With a deep understanding of loss and the fragility of life, they made a promise to make every moment count. Together, they embraced joy, love, and adventure, knowing that life was a precious gift to be treasured.\n\nAnd so, the story of Emma, Dylan, Oliver, and Ethan intertwined in a dance of love, loss, and resilience. Through the highs and lows, they learned that life is about embracing the present, cherishing the memories, and never losing hope in the power of love.", "TG": "(Dylan Sanders was born in Boston) starts at 1962\n(Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama) starts at 1964\n(Emma Reynolds was born in Palm Springs) starts at 1966\n(Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds) starts at 1972\n(Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds) ends at 1976\n(Emma Reynolds was married to Ethan Daniels) starts at 1989\n(Emma Reynolds was married to Ethan Daniels) ends at 1992\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds) starts at 1998\n(Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson) starts at 1998\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds) ends at 2009\n(Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson) ends at 2009\n(Ethan Daniels died in Pacific City) starts at 2010\n(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders) starts at 2012\n(Dylan Sanders was married to Emma Reynolds) starts at 2012\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds) or (Dylan Sanders was born in Boston)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds)", "(Dylan Sanders was born in Boston)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson) or (Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama)?", "C": ["(Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson)", "(Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama) or (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama)", "(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds) or (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)?", "C": ["(Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds)", "(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds) or (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds)", "(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds) or (Dylan Sanders was born in Boston)?", "C": ["(Ethan Daniels was married to Emma Reynolds)", "(Dylan Sanders was born in Boston)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders) or (Emma Reynolds was born in Palm Springs)?", "C": ["(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)", "(Emma Reynolds was born in Palm Springs)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama) or (Ethan Daniels died in Pacific City)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson was born in Birmingham, Alabama)", "(Ethan Daniels died in Pacific City)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Reynolds was married to Ethan Daniels) or (Emma Reynolds was born in Palm Springs)?", "C": ["(Emma Reynolds was married to Ethan Daniels)", "(Emma Reynolds was born in Palm Springs)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson) or (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)?", "C": ["(Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson)", "(Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emma Reynolds was married to Oliver Thompson), (Ethan Daniels died in Pacific City), (Dylan Sanders was born in Boston), (Emma Reynolds was married to Dylan Sanders), (Oliver Thompson was married to Emma Reynolds).

His witty personality and friendly nature made him popular among his peers.\n\nIn 1961, just a couple of years later, Benjamin Hudson came into the world in the sunny city of Burbank, California. As he grew up, Benjamin developed a deep passion for the entertainment industry, always dreaming of becoming a filmmaker.\n\nYears passed, and in 1978, a talented young woman named Emily Thompson was born in Oakland. From an early age, Emily showed an immense artistic talent, whether it was writing, singing, or painting. Her creative spirit was unstoppable.\n\nIn 1989, fate brought Liam Fitzgerald and Benjamin Hudson together. Their shared sense of humor and similar interests quickly formed a strong bond between the two. They realized they were more than just friends and decided to take their relationship to the next level. That year, Liam and Benjamin made a commitment to one another in a beautiful ceremony, promising to support and love each other for the rest of their lives.\n\nTheir love story blossomed, and their laughter echoed through the streets of San Francisco as they embarked on countless adventures together. They attended art exhibits, explored the natural beauty of Northern California, and nurtured their individual passions while cherishing their shared dreams.\n\nHowever, as time passed, Liam and Benjamin discovered that their romantic relationship had run its course. The year 1993 marked the end of their marriage, but not the end of their friendship. They chose to part ways amicably, remembering the beautiful moments they had shared and wishing each other nothing but happiness for the future.\n\nIn 2014, Benjamin Hudson found love once again. This time, it was with Emily Thompson, a kindred spirit who understood his creative soul. Their shared interests and passion for the arts created a deep connection between them. In a whirlwind of love and joy, Benjamin and Emily got married, vowing to support each other's dreams and ambitions.\n\nTogether, Benjamin and Emily embarked on a new chapter of their lives. They traveled the world, capturing its beauty through Benjamin's lens and drawing inspiration from the varied cultures they encountered. Their love story became a tale of artistic exploration and endless possibilities.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Liam Fitzgerald, Benjamin Hudson, and Emily Thompson intertwined in a tale of friendship, love, and creativity. Each person's unique journey brought them to where they were meant to be, creating a beautiful tapestry of life in the heart of California.", "TG": "(Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco) starts at 1959\n(Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California) starts at 1961\n(Emily Thompson was born in Oakland) starts at 1978\n(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson) starts at 1989\n(Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald) starts at 1989\n(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson) ends at 1993\n(Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald) ends at 1993\n(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson) starts at 2014\n(Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 2014\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Oakland) or (Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Oakland)", "(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald) or (Emily Thompson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson) or (Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson)", "(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson) or (Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California)?", "C": ["(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)", "(Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco) or (Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald)?", "C": ["(Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco)", "(Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco) or (Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California)?", "C": ["(Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco)", "(Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Emily Thompson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson) or (Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson)", "(Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Benjamin Hudson was married to Liam Fitzgerald)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Hudson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Liam Fitzgerald was born in San Francisco), (Emily Thompson was married to Benjamin Hudson), (Emily Thompson was born in Oakland), (Liam Fitzgerald was married to Benjamin Hudson), (Benjamin Hudson was born in Burbank, California).

As he grew up, Oliver's path would cross with a spirited young woman named Sophia Turner, who was born in the quaint village of Wanderers in 1899.\n\nThe two became inseparable, their love blossoming with each passing day. Finally, in the year 1922, Oliver and Sophia tied the knot, vowing to spend their lives together. Their love was a beacon of happiness and warmth for all who knew them.\n\nFor a few blissful years, Oliver Thompson and Sophia Turner shared a life filled with love and joy. However, their story took an unforeseen turn in 1926 when their marriage came to an end. Hearts broke, and tears fell, as Oliver and Sophia realized they were better off apart.\n\nIn the years that followed, life took its course, and both Oliver and Sophia searched for happiness. Eventually, Sophia found solace in the arms of another, a kind and gentle soul named Lily Thompson. In 1932, Sophia and Lily made a commitment to build a future together, promising to love and support each other.\n\nBut as fate would have it, even this union did not last forever. Their love story reached its conclusion in 1934 when Sophia and Lily decided to part ways. They remained friends, cherishing the memories and shared experiences they had created during their time together.\n\nIn the years that followed, Sophia Turner lived a rich and fulfilling life. She touched the lives of many, spreading warmth and happiness wherever she went. Finally, in the year 1960, Sophia took her last breath in the vibrant city of San Francisco, leaving behind a legacy of love and kindness.\n\nOliver Thompson's journey continued as well. Although his heart had known love and loss, he found solace in his memories and the love he had shared with Sophia. Oliver lived a long life, and in 1974, he too bid farewell to the world, passing away peacefully in the same city where Sophia had found her rest.\n\nAs for Lily Thompson, she pursued her dreams and passions, embracing life in all its glory. In 1974, as Oliver left this world, Lily too left a lasting impression. She departed from Dover, Delaware, having left an indelible mark on the lives of those who had the pleasure of knowing her.\n\nAnd so, the intertwined lives of Oliver Thompson, Sophia Turner, and Lily Thompson became a tale of love, loss, and resilience. Their stories remind us that life's journey is unpredictable, but in the end, it is the love we share that truly defines us.", "TG": "(Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois) starts at 1887\n(Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers) starts at 1899\n(Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson) starts at 1922\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Sophia Turner) starts at 1922\n(Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson) ends at 1926\n(Oliver Thompson was married to Sophia Turner) ends at 1926\n(Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson) starts at 1932\n(Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner) starts at 1932\n(Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson) ends at 1934\n(Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner) ends at 1934\n(Sophia Turner died in San Francisco) starts at 1960\n(Oliver Thompson died in San Francisco) starts at 1974\n(Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware) starts at 1974\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson died in San Francisco) or (Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson died in San Francisco)", "(Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers) or (Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers)", "(Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Turner died in San Francisco) or (Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois)?", "C": ["(Sophia Turner died in San Francisco)", "(Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware) or (Oliver Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)?", "C": ["(Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware)", "(Oliver Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware) or (Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois)?", "C": ["(Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware)", "(Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Thompson died in San Francisco) or (Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers)?", "C": ["(Oliver Thompson died in San Francisco)", "(Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson) or (Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)?", "C": ["(Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson)", "(Lily Thompson was married to Sophia Turner)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson) or (Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Turner was married to Oliver Thompson)", "(Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Lily Thompson died in Dover, Delaware), (Sophia Turner was born in Wanderers), (Oliver Thompson was born in Edgewater, Illinois), (Sophia Turner died in San Francisco), (Sophia Turner was married to Lily Thompson).

He grew up in a loving and caring family, surrounded by the gentle rolling hills and picturesque landscapes of the Midwest.\n\nIn a different part of the country, in the quiet town of Whiteville, North Carolina, a boy named Daniel S. Simmons was born in 1939. Raised with strong values and a deep appreciation for simplicity, he embraced the charm of his southern roots.\n\nMeanwhile, in the year 1941, a little girl named Jennifer Thompson was born in a place called Wanderers. Her adventurous spirit matched the uniqueness of her birth location, forever shaping her vibrant personality.\n\nAs fate would have it, Jennifer and Daniel crossed paths in their journey through life, and in 1961, they found themselves vowing to love and cherish each other in matrimony. Their bond grew stronger with each passing year, as they navigated the joys and challenges that life threw their way. Together, they created a foundation of love and support, building a life they could both be proud of.\n\nHowever, as life often does, it took an unexpected turn. The year 1969 brought the end of their marriage, as Jennifer and Daniel decided to go their separate ways. Though their story together had ended, they remained grateful for the beautiful memories and lessons they had shared during their time together.\n\nYears later, in 2002, fate stepped in once again. Jennifer and Anthony crossed paths, and this time, their connection was undeniable. They fell in love and decided to embark on a new chapter of their lives together as husband and wife. Their love blossomed, reminding them that it is never too late to find happiness and companionship.\n\nAs the years went by, Jennifer and Anthony treasured their time together, cherishing every moment they shared. However, in 2015, tragedy struck when Jennifer passed away unexpectedly in Kingston, Wyoming. Anthony was left heartbroken, mourning the loss of his beloved wife. Their love story had come to an end, but the memories of their time together would forever hold a special place in Anthony's heart.\n\nAnd so concluded the intertwining stories of Anthony Harrison and Jennifer Thompson. Two souls who, though their paths may have taken different turns, were brought together by fate and shared a love that would always be remembered.", "TG": "(Anthony Harrison was born in Edgewater, Illinois) starts at 1936\n(Daniel S.

Michael grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature and developed a passion for the arts from an early age.\n\nJust a year later, in 1928, another child named Scott Smith was born in the same town. Although Michael and Scott lived only a year apart, their paths would cross in a way that neither of them could have anticipated.\n\nYears went by, and in the nearby town of Springfield, a young girl named Emma Parker came into the world in 1942. Emma was a bright and ambitious individual, always dreaming of a life filled with excitement and adventure.\n\nMeanwhile, in Quinton Town, New York, Olivia Harrison was born in 1945. She possessed a natural grace and talent that captivated those around her. Growing up, Olivia aspired to make her mark on the world and pursued her dreams with unwavering determination.\n\nThe paths of these four individuals eventually converged in the late 1960s. In 1968, Scott Smith and Olivia Harrison found themselves drawn to one another, embarking on a journey of love and companionship. The two were inseparable, creating a bond strong enough to withstand any challenge.\n\nIn the same year, Michael Johnson fell deeply in love with Emma Parker and they married in 1973. Their connection was fueled by their shared passion for the arts, as they supported and uplifted each other's dreams.\n\nTragically, in 1980, Scott Smith's life was cut short in an unfortunate incident in Oceanview. The loss was devastating for Olivia Harrison, as their love story had abruptly come to an end. Their marriage dissolved, leaving Olivia to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart.\n\nSimilarly, in 1983, after a decade of marriage, Emma Parker and Michael Johnson decided to part ways. Although they had shared love and happiness, their diverging paths led them to different horizons.\n\nDespite the trials they endured, Michael managed to find light amidst darkness.

individuals named Emily Anderson and Liam Collins were born in different cities. Emily was born in the bustling town of Springfield, while Liam entered the world in the serene riverside town of Riverside. Little did they know that their paths would eventually cross in a twist of fate.\n\nAs the years went by, Emily and Liam embarked on their separate journeys, unaware of the connection that awaited them. Emily, a bright young woman, grew up in Springfield while Liam, an adventurous spirit, explored life in Riverside. They learned valuable lessons, experienced joys and sorrows, and took steps towards their futures.\n\nIn 1943, destiny intervened, and Emily and Liam found each other. They met in a chance encounter and, despite the odds, fell deeply in love. Their marriage became a testament to the strength of their bond and the resilience of their commitment. For several blissful years, they shared their lives, creating beautiful memories together.\n\nHowever, life has a way of changing course unexpectedly. In 1947, Emily and Liam's marriage reached its end. They parted ways, both grateful for the love they had shared but understanding that they needed to pursue different paths. Their parting was amicable, and they carried the cherished memories of their time together in their hearts.\n\nBut fate was not yet done weaving its intricate tapestry. In 1948, Liam crossed paths with a remarkable woman named Sophia Thompson in his hometown of Riverside. They were drawn to each other's magnetic personalities, and love blossomed once again. Liam and Sophia married, deciding to embark on a new chapter together. Their bond was strong and resilient, proving that love can find its way even after heartbreak.\n\nAs the years rolled on, Liam lived a fulfilling life with Sophia by his side. However, tragedy struck when Liam passed away in 1976 in Manchester, New Hampshire. Sophia was left heartbroken, but she cherished the beautiful memories they had created together.\n\nIn 1982, Sophia passed away peacefully in her hometown of Atlanta. She had lived a life filled with love, resilience, and the warmth of cherished memories. The lives of Emily, Liam, and Sophia had intertwined in unexpected ways, leaving behind a legacy of love and resilience that would be remembered for generations to come.\n\nAnd so, their story serves as a reminder that life is a journey, full of twists and turns. Fate may bring people together, separate them, and then bring them back together in unexpected ways. But through it all, love remains a constant, binding hearts and leaving behind a legacy that transcends time.", "TG": "(Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins) starts at 1943\n(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson) starts at 1943\n(Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins) ends at 1947\n(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson) ends at 1947\n(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins) starts at 1948\n(Liam Collins was married to Sophia Thompson) starts at 1948\n(Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire) starts at 1976\n(Liam Collins was married to Sophia Thompson) ends at 1976\n(Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta) starts at 1982\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta) or (Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta)", "(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Collins was married to Sophia Thompson) or (Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)?", "C": ["(Liam Collins was married to Sophia Thompson)", "(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire) or (Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)?", "C": ["(Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire)", "(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins) or (Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins)", "(Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins) or (Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins)", "(Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire) or (Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire)", "(Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins)?", "C": ["(Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire) or (Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins)?", "C": ["(Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire)", "(Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Anderson was married to Liam Collins), (Liam Collins was married to Emily Anderson), (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam Collins), (Liam Collins died in Manchester, New Hampshire), (Sophia Thompson died in Atlanta).

{"story": "Once upon a time, in the quaint town of Lancaster, a remarkable woman named Sophie Carter was born in 1907. She grew up in a loving family and always had a passion for the arts. Little did she know that her life would be filled with unexpected twists and turns.\n\nIn nearby Harrison, another individual by the name of Maxwell Reynolds was born in 1908. Maxwell possessed a creative spirit and later became a renowned director. Fate had interesting plans for Maxwell and Sophie, as they were destined to cross paths.\n\nMoving forward to 1915, in the lively city of Leicester, Liam Henderson entered the world. Liam was a talented and charismatic individual who would also play a significant role in Sophie's life later on.\n\nFast forward to 1930 when Sophie Carter and Sophia Cruz found themselves deeply in love and decided to get married. Their relationship blossomed, but tragically, Sophia's life was cut short in 1932 when she passed away in Leicester. Their love story was short but powerful, leaving a profound impact on Sophie's life.\n\nIn 1936, Sophie found solace in the arms of Maxwell Reynolds, and they embarked on their own journey together. They shared a deep connection and decided to tie the knot. Life seemed to finally bring some stability and happiness to Sophie.\n\nMeanwhile, Liam Henderson made his mark on the world, but his heart longed for companionship. In 1946, he found love and married Liam Thompson. However, their love story reached an end in the same year.\n\nBut destiny had other plans as Sophie and Liam's paths unexpectedly converged in 1953. Their connection was undeniable, and they knew they had found their soulmates in one another. Sophie divorced Maxwell, and she and Liam started a new chapter together as they walked hand in hand through life.\n\nTheir love endured over the years, even though Liam and Sophie would later divorce in 1972. Despite their separation, their bond remained unbreakable, and they continued to support each other through life's ups and downs until Sophie's demise in 1994, in the tranquil town of Oceanview.\n\nSophie Carter's life journey was filled with love, loss, and the pursuit of happiness. Her story serves as a reminder that no matter the struggles we face, fate often brings us to the people who truly matter, shaping our lives in unimaginable ways.", "TG": "(Sophie Carter was born in Lancaster) starts at 1907\n(Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison) starts at 1908\n(Liam Henderson was born in Leicester) starts at 1915\n(Sophia Cruz was married to Sophie Carter) starts at 1930\n(Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz) starts at 1930\n(Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz) ends at 1932\n(Sophia Cruz died in Leicester) starts at 1932\n(Sophia Cruz was married to Sophie Carter) ends at 1932\n(Sophie Carter was married to Maxwell Reynolds (director)) starts at 1936\n(Maxwell Reynolds (director) was married to Sophie Carter) starts at 1936\n(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson) starts at 1946\n(Liam Henderson was married to Sophie Carter) starts at 1953\n(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson) ends at 1953\n(Sophie Carter was married to Liam Henderson) starts at 1953\n(Liam Henderson was married to Sophie Carter) ends at 1972\n(Sophie Carter died in Oceanview) starts at 1994\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Cruz died in Leicester) or (Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz)?", "C": ["(Sophia Cruz died in Leicester)", "(Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Henderson was born in Leicester) or (Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)?", "C": ["(Liam Henderson was born in Leicester)", "(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson) or (Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)", "(Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson) or (Sophie Carter was married to Liam Henderson)?", "C": ["(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)", "(Sophie Carter was married to Liam Henderson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Carter was married to Maxwell Reynolds (director)) or (Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophie Carter was married to Maxwell Reynolds (director))", "(Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Maxwell Reynolds (director) was married to Sophie Carter) or (Sophie Carter died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Maxwell Reynolds (director) was married to Sophie Carter)", "(Sophie Carter died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Carter was married to Maxwell Reynolds (director)) or (Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz)?", "C": ["(Sophie Carter was married to Maxwell Reynolds (director))", "(Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Cruz died in Leicester) or (Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(Sophia Cruz died in Leicester)", "(Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz) or (Sophie Carter was married to Liam Henderson)?", "C": ["(Sophie Carter was married to Sophia Cruz)", "(Sophie Carter was married to Liam Henderson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Maxwell Reynolds (director) was born in Harrison), (Liam Henderson was married to Liam Thompson), (Liam Henderson was born in Leicester), (Sophia Cruz was married to Sophie Carter), (Sophie Carter died in Oceanview).

was born in the charming city of Springfield, Illinois. He grew up in a modest household, surrounded by the love and care of his parents.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in 1915, another baby boy named Connor Brooks came into the world in the vibrant city of San Francisco. Raised in a bustling city atmosphere, Connor developed a keen eye for art and an adventurous spirit.\n\nLittle did they know that their paths would cross in the most unexpected and profound way. It was in the year 1943 when Matthew and Connor finally met and instantly formed a deep connection. They fell in love, defying societal norms and embracing their true selves. Their love for each other knew no boundaries, and in a simple ceremony, they pledged their love and commitment to one another.\n\nAs fate would have it, it was during this same year, 1943, that Sophie Johnson, a talented and visionary artist, created a timeless masterpiece called Singin' in the Rain. The world was captivated by her talent, and her creation became a beloved cultural icon that would endure for generations to come.\n\nMatthew and Connor's love transcended time and challenges, but like any journey, theirs had chapters that came to an end. In 1950, they bid farewell to their matrimonial vows, realizing that their paths needed to diverge. They parted ways amicably, cherishing the memories they had created together.\n\nLife took an unexpected turn for Connor when, in 1952, he found love once again. This time, destiny led him into the arms of the talented Sophie Johnson. They embarked on a new journey together, embracing their shared passions and supporting each other in their artistic endeavors. Theirs was a love story that blossomed with creativity and inspiration.\n\nFor over a decade, Connor and Sophie painted their lives with love, creating masterpieces not only on canvas but within their hearts. However, in 1965, their love story came to a poignant end. Connor mourned the loss of Sophie, who passed away in Manchester, New Hampshire. Her legacy lived on, forever remembered through the beauty she left behind.\n\nTime kept moving forward, and Matthew, having lived a fulfilling and independent life, reached the year 1989. It was in the peaceful town of Kingston, Wyoming, that he drew his last breath, surrounded by the memories he treasured and the love he had experienced.\n\nLastly, in 2005, an era came to its conclusion as Connor Brooks bid farewell to the world in Kingston, Wyoming. His journey had been filled with love, creativity, and connections that shaped his soul.\n\nThough their stories intertwined, their lives stood separate, leaving behind a tapestry of memories, love, and art. The legacies of Matthew Dawson, Connor Brooks, and Sophie Johnson continued to inspire generations, reminding us all of the power of love and the beauty that can be created within the fleeting moments of our lives.", "TG": "(Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois) starts at 1913\n(Connor Brooks was born in San Francisco) starts at 1915\n(Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks) starts at 1943\n(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson) starts at 1943\n(Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks) ends at 1950\n(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson) ends at 1950\n(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson) starts at 1952\n(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson) ends at 1965\n(Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming) starts at 1989\n(Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming) starts at 2005\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson) or (Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson)", "(Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson) or (Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson)", "(Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming) or (Connor Brooks was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming)", "(Connor Brooks was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming) or (Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming)", "(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson) or (Connor Brooks was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)", "(Connor Brooks was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois) or (Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks)?", "C": ["(Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois)", "(Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming) or (Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming)", "(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois) or (Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois)", "(Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson) or (Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson)", "(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson) or (Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Connor Brooks was married to Matthew Dawson)", "(Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Matthew Dawson was born in Springfield, Illinois), (Connor Brooks was married to Sophie Johnson), (Matthew Dawson died in Kingston, Wyoming), (Matthew Dawson was married to Connor Brooks), (Connor Brooks died in Kingston, Wyoming).

Growing up in a loving family, Luke was a curious and determined young boy, always eager to explore the world around him.\n\nAs Luke excelled academically, his passion for education led him to pursue higher studies in San Francisco State University in 1954. It was here that Luke delved deep into his field of interest, immersing himself in knowledge and honing his intellectual prowess.\n\nLuke's dedication and hard work did not go unnoticed, and in 1961, he was offered a position at San Francisco State University, allowing him to contribute to the institution that had nurtured his academic growth. But Luke's thirst for knowledge could not be quenched solely by his work, and he decided to expand his horizons.\n\nIn the same year, Luke embarked on a new educational journey at Oceanview College in Boston. This opportunity allowed him to broaden his perspective and explore different approaches to his field. However, Luke's insatiable thirst for knowledge did not end here.\n\nIn 1972, Luke ventured into the prestigious Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences, where he worked diligently to contribute to groundbreaking research. His dedication and innovative ideas made a lasting impact, further enhancing his reputation as a prominent figure in his field.\n\nContinuing his remarkable academic journey, Luke's brilliance caught the attention of Harvard University in 1978, where he became an esteemed member of their faculty. His expertise and valuable contributions to the institution elevated his status as an educator and researcher.\n\nSeeking new challenges, Luke decided to return to his roots. In 1986, he accepted a position at Oceanview College in Boston once again, where he shared his wealth of knowledge with eager students and continued to make strides in his field.\n\nNever complacent, Luke's desire for growth led him to Oakland College in 1993. At this renowned institution, he embraced the opportunity to mentor young minds and inspire the future generation of professionals. Luke's dedication to education and his students' success was unwavering.\n\nYears of dedication culminated in 2002 when Luke was honored with the prestigious Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies. This recognition not only validated Luke's tireless efforts but also provided testament to his expertise and lasting impact on the academic world.\n\nWith each passing year, Luke Johnson's journey painted a picture of unwavering dedication, perseverance, and a burning passion for education. His remarkable contributions to various institutions will forever be celebrated, shaping the minds and futures of countless individuals who had the privilege of learning from him.", "TG": "(Luke Johnson was born in Austin) starts at 1934\n(Luke Johnson studied in San Francisco State University) starts at 1954\n(Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University) starts at 1961\n(Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston) starts at 1961\n(Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences) starts at 1972\n(Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University) starts at 1978\n(Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston) starts at 1986\n(Luke Johnson worked at Oakland College) starts at 1993\n(Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies) starts at 2002\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies) or (Luke Johnson studied in San Francisco State University)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies)", "(Luke Johnson studied in San Francisco State University)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences) or (Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences)", "(Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies) or (Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies)", "(Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences) or (Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences)", "(Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Oakland College) or (Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Oakland College)", "(Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston) or (Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston)", "(Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University) or (Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University)", "(Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University) or (Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at San Francisco State University)", "(Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences) or (Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Cambridge Institute for Social Sciences)", "(Luke Johnson won prize Lionheart Memorial Award in Financial Studies)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University) or (Luke Johnson was born in Austin)?", "C": ["(Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University)", "(Luke Johnson was born in Austin)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Luke Johnson worked at Oceanview College, Boston), (Luke Johnson worked at Oakland College), (Luke Johnson worked at Harvard University), (Luke Johnson studied in San Francisco State University), (Luke Johnson studied in Oceanview College, Boston).

vibrant city of Bristol, Emily Thompson was born in 1920. Growing up in a town filled with history and charm, Emily's curiosity knew no bounds. Little did she know that her life would become intertwined with two other remarkable individuals, Sophie Reynolds and Michael Johnson, in the years to come.\n\nIn 1932, across the tranquil shores of Oceanview, Michael Johnson was born. As he took his first breath, the world seemed to hold immeasurable promise for him. Oceanview's mesmerizing landscapes and the vast ocean filled Michael's heart with a sense of adventure.\n\nA year later, in 1933, across the majestic Bay Area, Sophie Reynolds was born. San Francisco's bustling streets and diverse culture shaped Sophie's perspective from an early age. She possessed a natural magnetism that drew people to her, captivating them with her enchanting personality.\n\nTime passed, and it was in the year 1969 that fate brought Emily and Sophie together. The connection between them was inexplicable, as if they were destined to be a part of each other's lives. They vowed to spend their lives together, their love intertwining like the intricacies of a fine tapestry.\n\nBut love knows no boundaries nor definitions, and in 1969, Emily and Sophie challenged societal norms and declared their unwavering commitment to each other once more. They embarked on a journey unlike any other, ignoring the judgment and embracing a love that was pure and true.\n\nAlas, their love story was not meant to be everlasting. In 1975, their beloved journey came to an end, and they bid each other farewell, cherishing the memories they had created together. Though their paths diverged, the impact of their love remained etched in their souls forever.\n\nIn the years that followed, Emily met Michael Johnson. In 1997, their worlds collided, intertwining their lives in a new chapter of love. The two found solace in one another, creating a unique and profound bond. They navigated life's challenges together, their love becoming a sanctuary in a world that often felt tumultuous.\n\nYet, as life goes, love stories sometimes face unexpected turns. In the year 2000, Emily's journey concluded, leaving behind a void in Michael's heart that could never be filled. The love they shared, though fleeting, left an indelible mark on their souls, a testament to the profound connection they had forged.\n\nIn 2013, the city of Oceanview was engulfed in sorrow as Michael bid his final farewell, reuniting with Emily once more. The story of their lives, filled with remarkable moments and enduring love, painted a picture of resilience and the power of human connections.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Emily Thompson, Sophie Reynolds, and Michael Johnson weaves a tapestry of love, sacrifice, and the profound impact of the human spirit. Their stories, though distinct, remind us of the beauty and fragility of life, and how love can transcend time, place, and the constraints of societal expectations.", "TG": "(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) starts at 1920\n(Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview) starts at 1932\n(Sophie Reynolds was born in San Francisco) starts at 1933\n(Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1969\n(Emily Thompson was married to Sophie Reynolds) starts at 1969\n(Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 1975\n(Emily Thompson was married to Sophie Reynolds) ends at 1975\n(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1997\n(Emily Thompson was married to Michael Johnson) starts at 1997\n(Emily Thompson died in Oakland) starts at 2000\n(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson) ends at 2000\n(Emily Thompson was married to Michael Johnson) ends at 2000\n(Michael Johnson died in Oceanview) starts at 2013\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Michael Johnson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Michael Johnson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) or (Emily Thompson was married to Michael Johnson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Michael Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Emily Thompson died in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson died in Oakland)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) or (Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol)", "(Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Reynolds was born in San Francisco) or (Emily Thompson died in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Sophie Reynolds was born in San Francisco)", "(Emily Thompson died in Oakland)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) or (Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol)", "(Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) or (Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol)", "(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol) or (Sophie Reynolds was born in San Francisco)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Bristol)", "(Sophie Reynolds was born in San Francisco)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson) or (Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Sophie Reynolds was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson) or (Emily Thompson was married to Sophie Reynolds)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Sophie Reynolds)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Johnson was married to Emily Thompson), (Emily Thompson was married to Sophie Reynolds), (Michael Johnson was born in Oceanview), (Emily Thompson was born in Bristol), (Emily Thompson died in Oakland).

From the moment he came into this world, it was clear that Matthew had a special spark within him.\n\nAs Matthew grew older, his passion for knowledge and exploration intensified. He immersed himself in books about the wonders of the universe and developed a deep love for cosmology. Little did he know that his thirst for understanding the cosmos would one day lead him to great achievements.\n\nIn 1931, Matthew Turner's brilliance was recognized as he was awarded the prestigious Hudson Award for his groundbreaking research in astrophysics. This accolade propelled him into the limelight and opened doors to endless opportunities.\n\nThroughout the following years, Matthew's dedication to his field remained unwavering. In 1945, he was honored once again, this time with the Astoria Award in Cosmology. His groundbreaking findings not only pushed the boundaries of scientific knowledge but also inspired countless young minds to explore the mysteries of the universe.\n\nIn 1953, Matthew's brilliance was acknowledged yet again as he became a Member of the National Academy. This distinguished recognition solidified his status as one of the most prominent scientists of his time. However, accolades and awards were not all Matthew sought.\n\nIn 1956, he was presented with the Williams Trophy for his outstanding contribution to the field of astrophysics. It was a testament to the years of dedication and hard work that Matthew had poured into his research.\n\nBut Matthew's journey was far from over. In 1958, he was honored with the Galaxy Science Award, marking his significant impact on the scientific community. However, it was also during this year that tragedy struck. Matthew Turner passed away in Manchester, leaving behind a legacy that would inspire future generations of scientists.\n\nMatthew Turner's life was a testament to the power of curiosity, perseverance, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. His contributions to the field of cosmology continue to shape our understanding of the vast universe we inhabit. Though he may no longer be with us, his name lives on, forever etched in the annals of scientific history.", "TG": "(Matthew Turner was born in Denver) starts at 1900\n(Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award) starts at 1931\n(Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology) starts at 1945\n(Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy) starts at 1953\n(Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy) starts at 1956\n(Matthew Turner won prize Galaxy Science Award) starts at 1958\n(Matthew Turner died in Manchester) starts at 1958\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy) or (Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner died in Manchester) or (Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner died in Manchester)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner died in Manchester) or (Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner died in Manchester)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy) or (Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy) or (Matthew Turner died in Manchester)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy)", "(Matthew Turner died in Manchester)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner was born in Denver) or (Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner was born in Denver)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award) or (Matthew Turner was born in Denver)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award)", "(Matthew Turner was born in Denver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy) or (Matthew Turner won prize Galaxy Science Award)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Galaxy Science Award)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy) or (Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy)?", "C": ["(Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy)", "(Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Matthew Turner won prize Galaxy Science Award), (Matthew Turner won prize Member of the National Academy), (Matthew Turner won prize Williams Trophy), (Matthew Turner won prize Hudson Award), (Matthew Turner won prize Astoria Award in Cosmology).

Growing up in a vibrant and diverse community, he was surrounded by the energy and spirit that the city had to offer.\n\nAcross the state, in the serene town of Carlton, California, Sophia Anderson was born in 1926. From a young age, Sophia developed a deep love for nature and the peaceful atmosphere of her hometown.\n\nAs fate would have it, their paths eventually crossed in 1945, when Sophia and David tied the knot. Their love blossomed, and they embarked on a shared journey filled with joy, laughter, and adventure. They cherished every moment together, supporting one another through life's ups and downs.\n\nHowever, their union was not meant to last forever. In the same year they got married, Sophia and David sadly decided to part ways. Although their love had faded, they remained respectful and caring towards each other, maintaining a sense of friendship even after their marriage ended.\n\nYears down the line, in 1966, David's path crossed with Nina Daniels, a spirited and vivacious woman from Boston. They discovered a deep connection, and their love story began. Over the years, they built a life together, filled with shared dreams and aspirations. Their marriage stood strong, a testament to the love and commitment they had for one another.\n\nBut as time passed, David's health began to decline. In 2001, he tragically passed away in Brookville Heights, Boston. The news of his demise left Nina devastated, as she mourned the loss of her beloved partner. Though their time together was cut short, the memories they shared would forever be engrained in Nina's heart.\n\nAnd so, the intertwined lives of David, Sophia, and Nina tell a tale of love, growth, and resilience. From the first breaths they took in their respective hometowns to the final chapter that closed in Boston, their stories are reminders of the remarkable journeys that can unfold when paths converge and love weaves its intricate tapestry among them.", "TG": "(David Thompson was born in Oakland) starts at 1913\n(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California) starts at 1926\n(Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson) starts at 1945\n(David Thompson was married to Sophia Anderson) starts at 1945\n(Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson) ends at 1945\n(David Thompson was married to Sophia Anderson) ends at 1945\n(Nina Daniels was married to David Thompson) starts at 1966\n(David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels) starts at 1966\n(David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston) starts at 2001\n(Nina Daniels was married to David Thompson) ends at 2001\n(David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels) ends at 2001\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California) or (David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels)?", "C": ["(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)", "(David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)?", "C": ["(David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Thompson was born in Oakland) or (David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels)?", "C": ["(David Thompson was born in Oakland)", "(David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California) or (Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)", "(Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Thompson was married to Sophia Anderson) or (David Thompson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(David Thompson was married to Sophia Anderson)", "(David Thompson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson)?", "C": ["(David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (David Thompson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(David Thompson died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(David Thompson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California) or (Nina Daniels was married to David Thompson)?", "C": ["(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)", "(Nina Daniels was married to David Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California) or (David Thompson was born in Oakland)?", "C": ["(Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California)", "(David Thompson was born in Oakland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Nina Daniels was married to David Thompson), (Sophia Anderson was married to David Thompson), (David Thompson was born in Oakland), (Sophia Anderson was born in Carlton, California), (David Thompson was married to Nina Daniels).

Luke Mitchell, a charismatic and ambitious young man, was born in 1914 to a local family, while Emily Thompson, a vibrant and free-spirited girl, came into the world three years later in 1917.\n\nAs fate would have it, Luke and Emily's paths crossed when they were just teenagers. Their shared love for adventures and exploration brought them closer, forging a friendship that would stand the test of time. Their bond grew stronger as they grew older, and in 1948, both Luke and Emily realized that their connection ran even deeper. They took the leap of faith and decided to get married, promising to face the joys and challenges of life together.\n\nLuke Mitchell, always striving for greatness, found success in his endeavors. In 1975, he achieved acclaim by winning the prestigious Crimson Trophy, a top prize in his field. The achievement brought a sense of pride not only to Luke but also to Emily, who stood by his side through every triumph and setback.\n\nYears went by, and as the town of Harmonyville flourished, Luke and Emily's love remained unwavering. Sadly, in 1996, Luke passed away peacefully in the coastal town of Oceanview, leaving behind a legacy of hard work and determination that would continue to inspire the townsfolk for generations.\n\nEmily, though heartbroken by the loss of her beloved Luke, continued to embody the spirit of the couple's adventures throughout her life. She shared stories of their escapades and brought smiles to the faces of those who listened, cherishing the memories they had made together.\n\nTragedy struck again in 2011 when Emily Thompson breathed her last breath in Kingston, Wyoming, far from the rolling hills of Harmonyville. The news of her passing reverberated throughout the town, as friends and neighbors mourned the loss of a woman who had touched so many lives.\n\nIn the years following Luke and Emily's departure from this world, their stories lived on. The tale of Luke Mitchell winning the Crimson Trophy became a legend, encouraging the locals to reach for greatness in their own lives. Meanwhile, Emily's adventurous spirit became a symbol of the freedom and joy that Harmonyville represented, inspiring younger generations to embrace life's opportunities and cherish the bonds formed in their close-knit community.\n\nAnd so, the legacy of Luke Mitchell and Emily Thompson endured, their love and adventures immortalized in the hearts and minds of those who called Harmonyville home. Their story served as a reminder that even in the face of loss, love and memories could provide solace and hope, forever woven into the fabric of this enchanting town.", "TG": "(Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville) starts at 1914\n(Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville) starts at 1917\n(Emily Thompson was married to Luke Mitchell) starts at 1948\n(Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 1948\n(Luke Mitchell won prize Crimson Trophy) starts at 1975\n(Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview) starts at 1996\n(Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming) starts at 2011\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville) or (Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville)", "(Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was married to Luke Mitchell) or (Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was married to Luke Mitchell)", "(Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview) or (Emily Thompson was married to Luke Mitchell)?", "C": ["(Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview)", "(Emily Thompson was married to Luke Mitchell)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville) or (Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville)", "(Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville) or (Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Harmonyville)", "(Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview) or (Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview)", "(Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson) or (Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)?", "C": ["(Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview) or (Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)?", "C": ["(Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview)", "(Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson) or (Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)?", "C": ["(Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Thompson died in Kingston, Wyoming), (Luke Mitchell died in Oceanview), (Luke Mitchell was married to Emily Thompson), (Luke Mitchell was born in Harmonyville), (Luke Mitchell won prize Crimson Trophy).

upon a time in the small town of Tartanville, Benjamin Thompson came into this world in the year 1930. From a young age, Benjamin was known for his curious nature and adventurous spirit.\n\nA few years later, in 1936, Hannah Davis was born in the nearby town of Coventry. With her lively personality and a heart full of dreams, Hannah's infectious optimism brightened the lives of those around her.\n\nAs fate would have it, their paths crossed when Benjamin and Hannah fell in love. They tied the knot in 1957, promising to support and cherish each other forever. Their love story seemed to be one of pure bliss, but life had its own plans.\n\nIn 1966, Chris Johnson, a charismatic and ambitious individual, became associated with the Liberty Party in Boston. Chris was drawn to political discourse and believed in the power of positive change.\n\nSadly, the bond between Benjamin and Hannah began to fracture, and by 1969, their once-solid marriage ended in separation. Life took its toll on their love, leaving both Benjamin and Hannah with a bittersweet taste of what once was.\n\nA few years later, in 1974, Benjamin found solace in the arms of Emily Johnson, a free-spirited woman from San Francisco. They married, hoping to rebuild their lives together. However, their journey faced its own obstacles, and by 1982, their marriage too succumbed to the strains of life and they decided to part ways.\n\nLife, however, had not run out of surprises. In 2003, Hannah found herself once again walking down the aisle, this time with Chris Johnson. Their love offered a second chance at happiness, and together, they embarked on a new chapter filled with love and hope.\n\nAs the years went by, Chris became involved with the Freedom Alliance Party in 2004, passionately working toward their ideals. And although his previous association with the Liberty Party in Boston ended that same year, his commitment to shaping a better future for all never wavered.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Benjamin, Hannah, Chris, and Emily intertwined through time, each facing their own joys and tribulations. Their stories serve as a reminder that life can take unexpected turns but can still find a way to weave together the threads of love, friendship, and change.", "TG": "(Benjamin Thompson was born in Tartanville) starts at 1930\n(Hannah Davis was born in Coventry) starts at 1936\n(Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson) starts at 1957\n(Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis) starts at 1957\n(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston)) starts at 1966\n(Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis) ends at 1969\n(Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson) ends at 1969\n(Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson) starts at 1974\n(Benjamin Thompson was married to Emily Johnson) starts at 1974\n(Benjamin Thompson was married to Emily Johnson) ends at 1982\n(Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson) ends at 1982\n(Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson) starts at 2003\n(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Freedom Alliance Party) starts at 2004\n(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston)) ends at 2004\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson) or (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))?", "C": ["(Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson)", "(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis) or (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))?", "C": ["(Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis)", "(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston)) or (Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)?", "C": ["(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))", "(Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Thompson was born in Tartanville) or (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Freedom Alliance Party)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Thompson was born in Tartanville)", "(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Freedom Alliance Party)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Freedom Alliance Party) or (Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)?", "C": ["(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Freedom Alliance Party)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston)) or (Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)?", "C": ["(Chris Johnson was affiliated to Liberty Party (Boston))", "(Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson) or (Benjamin Thompson was born in Tartanville)?", "C": ["(Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson)", "(Benjamin Thompson was born in Tartanville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis) or (Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Hannah Davis was born in Coventry) or (Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)?", "C": ["(Hannah Davis was born in Coventry)", "(Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Benjamin Thompson was married to Emily Johnson) or (Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)?", "C": ["(Benjamin Thompson was married to Emily Johnson)", "(Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Johnson was married to Benjamin Thompson), (Hannah Davis was married to Chris Johnson), (Benjamin Thompson was married to Hannah Davis), (Hannah Davis was married to Benjamin Thompson), (Hannah Davis was born in Coventry).

From a young age, Charlie showed great talent and passion for various sports, particularly soccer and basketball.\n\nIn 2007, Charlie's abilities caught the attention of Manchester United, one of the most prestigious soccer clubs in the world. He was thrilled to join the team and was proud to wear the legendary red jersey. But Charlie's athletic prowess wasn't just limited to the soccer field.\n\nThat same year, Charlie also had the opportunity to represent Italy as a member of their national under-20 basketball team. It was a whirlwind experience, showcasing his versatility as an athlete and earning him admiration from fans and coaches alike.\n\nIn 2008, Charlie briefly left Manchester United to play for the Orange River soccer club. It was a chance for him to gain more playing time and further enhance his skills. However, his heart remained with Manchester United, and he returned to the club in 2009.\n\nFor the next few years, Charlie dedicated himself to Manchester United, training diligently and showcasing his talent on the field. His hard work paid off as he contributed to the team's success, earning praise from fans and teammates alike. However, in 2012, Charlie's time with Manchester United came to an end. Despite the disappointment, he remained determined to continue his soccer journey.\n\nIn 2013, Charlie joined Rosemary United Football Club, eager to prove himself once again. However, fate had different plans, and he left the club later that year. Charlie's resilience kept him going, and in 2014, he found a new home with Dallas United FC. He played with great dedication and skill for two seasons until 2015, leaving an indelible mark on the team and fans.\n\nIn 2016, it was time for Charlie to embark on a new adventure. He joined Everton Rovers, where he continued to shine and delight spectators with his incredible soccer skills. But fate had a surprise waiting for him. Later that year, Manchester United FC invited him back to the club. It was a dream come true for Charlie, and he eagerly rejoined the team that held a special place in his heart.\n\nCharlie's return to Manchester United FC in 2016 marked the beginning of a triumphant period in his career. He played passionately, proving his worth time and time again, until his final season with the club in 2017. The memories Charlie created, the victories he celebrated, and the friendships he forged would forever be cherished.\n\nToday, Charlie Johnson continues to spread his love for sports, using his experiences to inspire young athletes around the world. His journey, marked by determination and talent, serves as a reminder that hard work and passion can lead to extraordinary achievements.", "TG": "(Charlie Johnson was born in Wilmington) starts at 1989\n(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United) starts at 2007\n(Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team) starts at 2007\n(Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club) starts at 2008\n(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United) ends at 2012\n(Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club) starts at 2013\n(Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club) ends at 2013\n(Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC) starts at 2014\n(Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC) ends at 2015\n(Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers) starts at 2016\n(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC) starts at 2016\n(Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club) ends at 2016\n(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC) ends at 2017\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson was born in Wilmington) or (Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson was born in Wilmington)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United) or (Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club) or (Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC) or (Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team) or (Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Orange River soccer club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team) or (Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC) or (Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club) or (Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club)", "(Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United FC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team) or (Charlie Johnson was born in Wilmington)?", "C": ["(Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team)", "(Charlie Johnson was born in Wilmington)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Charlie Johnson played for Dallas United FC), (Charlie Johnson played for Rosemary United Football Club), (Charlie Johnson played for Manchester United), (Charlie Johnson played for Italy national under-20 basketball team), (Charlie Johnson played for Everton Rovers).

Adam Price, born in 1951, and Emily Thompson, born in 1953, had no idea that their paths would eventually intertwine in a most unexpected way.\n\nAs they grew older, Adam revealed a talent for leadership and a passion for politics. In 1990, he embarked on a journey that would shape his future. With a strong affiliation to the Royal politician, Adam began his foray into the world of governance. His dedication and intelligence quickly earned him recognition within the political sphere, and he aligned himself with the Greenwood Party, a group that shared his commitment to progressive and sustainable policies.\n\nAdam's involvement with the Greenwood Party flourished throughout the early 2000s, but as with all things, change was inevitable. In 2002, he decided to end his affiliation with the party, seeking new avenues to make a meaningful impact on society. Little did he know that his path was about to take an unexpected turn.\n\nIn 2005, fate brought Emily Thompson into Adam's life. Their connection was instant, and their love blossomed in the charming town they both called home. That year, amidst their shared happiness, Adam and Emily decided to exchange marital vows, a decision that would forever solidify their commitment to each other.\n\nThey embarked on a journey as partners, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. Emily, a beacon of support, nurtured Adam's honed leadership skills, encouraging him to pursue his true passion. And Adam, in turn, provided Emily with unwavering love and a sense of security.\n\nTogether, they vowed to make a difference, to foster positive change, and to create a better world for future generations. Their shared values and aspirations became the driving force behind everything they did. As Adam ventured into new realms of influence, Emily stood by his side, serving as his most trusted advisor and confidant.\n\nAnd so, their story continues, woven with love, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of making the world a better place. Born in Jupiter, these two extraordinary individuals found not only each other but also the power to impact lives far beyond their shared hometown. United by love and fueled by purpose, Adam Price and Emily Thompson remain a beacon of hope for all those seeking positive change.", "TG": "(Adam Price was born in Jupiter) starts at 1951\n(Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter) starts at 1953\n(Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician) starts at 1990\n(Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party) starts at 1990\n(Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party) ends at 2002\n(Emily Thompson was married to Adam Price) starts at 2005\n(Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson) starts at 2005\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was born in Jupiter) or (Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was born in Jupiter)", "(Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician) or (Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson) or (Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson) or (Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson) or (Adam Price was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Adam Price was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter) or (Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party)?", "C": ["(Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)", "(Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was born in Jupiter) or (Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was born in Jupiter)", "(Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson) or (Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party)?", "C": ["(Adam Price was married to Emily Thompson)", "(Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Emily Thompson was married to Adam Price), (Adam Price was born in Jupiter), (Adam Price was affiliated to Greenwood Party), (Adam Price was affiliated to Royal politician), (Emily Thompson was born in Jupiter).

talented young boy named Michael Davidson was born in 1968. From an early age, it was apparent that he possessed a remarkable passion for the beautiful game of soccer.\n\nAs Michael grew older, his skills on the field flourished, catching the attention of the prestigious River City FC. In 1989, at the tender age of 21, Michael was recruited to join the club's youth academy. It was a dream come true for the determined young player.\n\nFor the next two years, Michael dedicated himself to honing his abilities and learning from the experienced coaches and players within the River City FC organization. His hard work paid off when, in 1991, he donned the team's jersey and made his professional debut. Michael's talent and dedication quickly earned him a place in the hearts of the loyal River City FC supporters.\n\nHowever, life as a professional athlete is often transient, and after a successful year with River City FC, Michael found himself seeking another opportunity to continue his soccer journey. In 1992, he joined FC Thunderbird Edmonton, a team based in Canada. Michael embraced the new challenge with open arms, showcasing his skills on the field and leaving a lasting impression on both his teammates and fans alike.\n\nAfter a fruitful season with FC Thunderbird Edmonton, Michael moved on to Sunset City United in 1995. He brought his relentless work ethic and love for the game to the team, leaving an indelible mark on their history. However, his time with the club was short-lived as he made a move to Meadowville United in 1996.\n\nYet, fate had its own plans for Michael. He found himself back at Sunset City United later that year, eager to prove his worth once more. Michael's unwavering determination and undeniable talent elevated the team's performance, and he became a pivotal figure in their success.\n\nIn 1997, Michael's journey led him to Weston City FC. The club welcomed him with open arms, recognizing the invaluable experience and skillset he brought to the team. Year after year, Michael showcased his unwavering commitment, inspiring his teammates and delivering unforgettable performances on the field.\n\nBy 1998, Michael found himself donning the vibrant colors of Sunnydale United F.C. His infectious enthusiasm and unwavering dedication to the sport captivated fans and players alike. Michael's time with Sunnydale United F.C. marked the pinnacle of his career, both individually and as a team player.\n\nThroughout his soccer odyssey, Michael Davidson's journey was one of ambition, resilience, and unwavering passion for the game. From his humble beginnings in Boston to his numerous stops at esteemed football clubs, Michael left an everlasting impact on the hearts of supporters and teammates. He became a symbol of determination and a testament to the power of relentless pursuit of one's dreams.", "TG": "(Michael Davidson was born in Boston) starts at 1968\n(Michael Davidson played for River City FC) starts at 1989\n(Michael Davidson played for River City FC) ends at 1991\n(Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton) starts at 1992\n(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United) starts at 1995\n(Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United) starts at 1996\n(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United) ends at 1996\n(Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC) starts at 1997\n(Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.) starts at 1998\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC) or (Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC)", "(Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton) or (Michael Davidson played for River City FC)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton)", "(Michael Davidson played for River City FC)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC) or (Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC)", "(Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC) or (Michael Davidson was born in Boston)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC)", "(Michael Davidson was born in Boston)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for FC Thunderbird Edmonton)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Meadowville United)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.) or (Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)?", "C": ["(Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.)", "(Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Davidson played for Sunset City United), (Michael Davidson was born in Boston), (Michael Davidson played for Sunnydale United F.C.), (Michael Davidson played for River City FC), (Michael Davidson played for Weston City FC).

Growing up, Alex had a deep love for the game of football. His talent and passion for the sport were evident from a young age.\n\nAs he got older, Alex's skills on the field continued to develop, and in 2004, he earned a spot on the renowned FC Lyon team. Representing his beloved club, Alex played with determination and showcased his prowess on the pitch. However, his time with FC Lyon was short-lived, as he moved on to new opportunities the following year.\n\nIn 2007, Alex joined the ranks of L.J. Thompson, a team known for their tenacious play and camaraderie. He also simultaneously started playing for S.V. Olympus, a team that held great ambitions for success. It was a busy year for Alex, juggling between these two clubs and working hard to make a name for himself.\n\nIn 2008, Wimbledon Stadium became home to Alex Grant. He donned their colors proudly as he played alongside talented teammates, mesmerizing the crowd with his skills. However, his stint with Wimbledon Stadium ended the following year, and he had to bid farewell to his teammates and the buzzing stadium.\n\nUnfazed by the changes, Alex Grant continued to chase his dreams. In 2009, he joined Crystal Lake FC, a team known for their resilience and determination. He wholeheartedly embraced the challenge, giving his all on the field and leaving the fans in awe of his performances.\n\nThe year 2010 brought a new venture for Alex as he signed with the prestigious Royal Eagles. It was an exciting opportunity for him to showcase his abilities at a higher level. With every match, he proved his worth, leaving a lasting impact on both teammates and rivals.\n\nIn 2011, Alex decided to join Valley United, a team that had a reputation for nurturing young talent. Despite facing tough competition, he flourished in their environment, growing both as a player and an individual. However, his time with Valley United came to an end by the following year, allowing him to explore new horizons.\n\nIn 2013, Alex embarked on an exciting journey across the Atlantic, joining the New York Cosmos football team. The vibrant city and the passionate fans provided the perfect backdrop for him to shine. He relished the challenges and milestones that came his way, leaving an indelible mark on the team's history.\n\n2014 brought a change of scenery for Alex as he joined FC Phoenix United. Though his time with the club was short, he made a significant impact, leaving behind a legacy of hard work and determination.\n\nIn 2015, Alex's talent drew the attention of one of the world's biggest clubs, Manchester United. It was the pinnacle of his career, donning the iconic red jersey and playing alongside footballing legends. The experience was a dream come true, affirming his dedication and skill.\n\nHowever, his journey with Manchester United was brief, as he returned to FC Phoenix United later that year. It was a decision made with both personal and professional considerations in mind, acknowledging the love and loyalty he had developed for the club.\n\nThroughout his career, Alex Grant faced trials and triumphs, constantly adapting to new environments and challenges. His love for the game and unwavering dedication led him on a remarkable journey, proving that passion and hard work can make dreams come true in the world of football.

From a young age, he had a natural talent for sports and excelled in various athletic activities. However, it was football that captured his heart.\n\nIn 1985, Alex joined the Spartan Glory football team and quickly became one of their star players. His skills on the field were unmatched, and his passion for the game was evident in every match he played.\n\nBut Alex's talents were not limited to just football. In 1987, he had the opportunity to represent the Italy national under-20 basketball team. Dazzling audiences with his agility and precision, he proved to be an invaluable asset to the team.\n\nIn 1988, he switched gears and joined the Orange River soccer club. It didn't take long for Alex to make a name for himself in the club, earning the respect of his teammates and opponents alike with his unparalleled abilities.\n\nThe year 1989 marked a turning point in Alex's career as he joined the prestigious Southampton Athletic Club. His time there was filled with triumphs and victories, solidifying his status as a rising sports star. However, his journey with Southampton Athletic Club came to an end in 1990.\n\nNot one to be deterred, Alex Mason found a new home in Weston City later that year. He continued to showcase his skills and dedication to the game, capturing the attention of B.B.C. Liverpool in 1994. Alex joined the team and quickly became a fan favorite, but his time at B.B.C. Liverpool was short-lived. He decided to return to Weston City later that same year.\n\nIn 1997, Alex Mason received a dream offer from none other than Manchester United. He eagerly signed with the prestigious club and embarked on a remarkable journey that would shape his career. However, his time at Manchester United concluded in 1999.\n\nBut Alex's football journey was far from over. In the same year, he joined Manchester United F.C., determined to continue his love for the game. His skills continued to impress, catching the attention of the Blazing Tigers in Hartford. From 1999 to 2002, Alex played passionately for the Blazing Tigers, leaving an indelible mark on their history.\n\nAlex Mason's story exemplifies the extraordinary talent and unwavering passion that guided him through different sports and clubs.

He grew up in a close-knit community, surrounded by friends and family. As the years went by, Austin's path crossed with Liam McGrath, who was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1926. Despite coming from different places, both Austin and Liam shared a deep passion for adventure and exploration.\n\nIn 1956, Liam McGrath found love in the form of Sophia Thompson. Their connection was instantaneous, and they embarked on a beautiful journey together, getting married that same year. However, destiny had other plans, and their marriage came to an unexpected end in 1960.\n\nMeanwhile, Austin Murphy had always admired Sophia from afar, sensing an indescribable connection with her. Fate played its hand when Austin and Sophia found solace in each other's company, and in 1960, they exchanged vows, beginning a new chapter in their lives together.\n\nAs the years passed, Austin and Sophia's love grew stronger, cherishing every moment they spent together. They built a home filled with love, laughter, and wonderful memories. However, in 1971, their marriage sadly came to an end, and they went their separate ways.\n\nYears later, in 2006, Austin Murphy took his last breath in Harrisonville, Kentucky, leaving behind a legacy of courage and resilience. He was remembered by his friends and the community for his adventurous spirit and kind heart.\n\nOn the other hand, Liam McGrath continued his journey through life, never forgetting the love he once had for Sophia Thompson. In 2007, Liam's journey also came to a close in Cambridge, leaving behind memories of a life well-lived.\n\nThough their paths had crossed and diverged throughout the years, the stories of Austin Murphy and Liam McGrath intertwined in the tapestry of life. Their adventures, loves, and losses created a symphony of emotions, reminding us that every individual's story is woven intricately within the grander narrative of humanity.", "TG": "(Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls) starts at 1924\n(Liam McGrath was born in Northampton, Massachusetts) starts at 1926\n(Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson) starts at 1956\n(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath) starts at 1956\n(Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson) starts at 1960\n(Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy) starts at 1960\n(Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson) ends at 1960\n(Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson) ends at 1971\n(Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky) starts at 2006\n(Liam McGrath died in Cambridge) starts at 2007\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson) or (Liam McGrath died in Cambridge)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson)", "(Liam McGrath died in Cambridge)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam McGrath was born in Northampton, Massachusetts) or (Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)?", "C": ["(Liam McGrath was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)", "(Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky) or (Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky)", "(Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls) or (Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls)", "(Liam McGrath was married to Sophia Thompson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy) or (Liam McGrath was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)", "(Liam McGrath was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky) or (Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)?", "C": ["(Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky)", "(Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath) or (Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls)?", "C": ["(Sophia Thompson was married to Liam McGrath)", "(Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Austin Murphy was born in Greenwood Falls), (Sophia Thompson was married to Austin Murphy), (Austin Murphy died in Harrisonville, Kentucky), (Liam McGrath died in Cambridge), (Austin Murphy was married to Sophia Thompson).

named Liam Gallagher was born in 1935. Liam grew up in the close-knit community of the Foster Cooperative, surrounded by people who believed in the power of education and nurturing young minds.\n\nAs Liam blossomed into an intelligent and curious child, his teachers quickly recognized his exceptional talents. His passion for learning was infectious, inspiring his fellow students to strive for greatness. Liam's potential seemed limitless, and the village rallied behind him, determined to provide him with every opportunity to flourish.\n\nIn 1986, Liam's remarkable abilities garnered him the prestigious Smithson Trophy. This recognition catapulted him onto the national stage, bringing both pride and recognition to his beloved English Foster Cooperative. The prize served as a launching pad, propelling Liam even further on his extraordinary journey.\n\nFour years later, in 1990, Liam's dedication to scientific research earned him the coveted Taylor Jones Prize. His groundbreaking discoveries opened new avenues of exploration, earning him respect from the scientific community worldwide. Liam became a symbol of innovation and dedication, inspiring a generation of aspiring scientists.\n\nContinuing his winning streak, Liam secured the Eagle Award in Geometry in 1997. His unparalleled understanding of shapes and form left mathematicians astounded, further cementing his reputation as a true genius. The entire village celebrated this triumph, making sure to honor their local hero with a grand ceremony.\n\nBut Liam's thirst for knowledge was insatiable, and he continued to push the boundaries of his mind. In 2002, he was bestowed the Kennedy Award in Mathematics, yet another recognition of his unparalleled talent. His contributions to the field were groundbreaking, forever changing the landscape of mathematics.\n\nAs time went on, Liam's accolades grew, and in 2009, he received the prestigious Franklin Maxwell Award. This honor acknowledged his exceptional contributions to academic excellence and solidified his place in history. The village of Foster burst with pride, elated to be associated with such an exceptional mind.\n\nBy 2013, the world was well aware of Liam Gallagher's brilliance, and he was bestowed the Adam D. Barker Award for his pioneering work in his chosen field. The award recognized his tenacity and unwavering perseverance, inspiring young minds to pursue their dreams relentlessly.\n\nThe year 2014 marked another milestone in Liam's illustrious career. The Crabtree Award, a crowning achievement in the realm of academia, was bestowed upon him. This prestigious honor recognized his exceptional dedication to education and his community. Liam's name became synonymous with greatness, inspiring future generations to strive for excellence.\n\nAs the years went by, Liam Gallagher became a legend in his own right, his name whispered with admiration by scholars and dreamers alike. His contributions to human knowledge and the pursuit of truth left an indelible mark, forever changing the world for the better.\n\nAnd so, as Liam Gallagher's story continues, his legacy lives on, reminding all who come after him that greatness is within their reach, no matter the circumstances of their birth. The village of Foster, where it all began, will forever be proud to call Liam their own, forever inspired by his unwavering spirit and relentless pursuit of knowledge.", "TG": "(Liam Gallagher was born in English Foster Cooperative Free England) starts at 1935\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Smithson Trophy) starts at 1986\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Taylor Jones Prize for Scientific Research) starts at 1990\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Eagle Award in Geometry) starts at 1997\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Kennedy Award in Mathematics) starts at 2002\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Franklin Maxwell Award) starts at 2009\n(Liam Gallagher won prize Adam D.

From a very early age, Liam showed a natural talent for soccer. He joined the local youth team, the Phoenix Eagles, in 1988, where his skills quickly caught the attention of coaches and scouts.\n\nIn 1989, Liam had the opportunity to play for the Seattle Warriors under-17 football team. His performance at this level was outstanding, and he was also selected to represent the Cheshire national under-16 football team. Liam's passion for the game grew stronger with each passing day.\n\nHowever, Liam's time with the Phoenix Eagles came to an end in 1990 as he wanted to explore new horizons. In 1991, he joined R.W. Eastbridge, a team that provided him with more challenging competition. Liam later briefly reunited with his former team, R.T. Wolverhampton, before finally bidding farewell to R.W. Eastbridge in 1992.\n\nIn 1993, Liam embarked on a new journey by joining Oceanside United FC. This move proved to be pivotal in his career as he honed his skills and became a formidable player. A year later, in 1994, Liam's exceptional abilities drew the attention of Chelsea United FC, and he joined their ranks. He spent a year with the team, showcasing his talent and contributing to their success.\n\nHowever, Liam couldn't seem to settle down, and in 1995 he left Chelsea United FC. He took a break from competitive soccer for a few years to reassess his goals and ambitions. But Liam's love for the game never faded, and in 1998 he joined Dallas City FC. His return to the field was celebrated, and he played with unmatched passion until 1999 marked the end of his time with Dallas City FC.\n\nAlthough Liam Davis's soccer journey had its ups and downs, his perseverance and talent were undeniable. He left an indelible mark on every team he played for, inspiring his teammates and leaving a lasting impression on coaches and fans alike. Liam's story serves as a reminder that passion, determination, and love for the sport drive us to overcome obstacles and achieve greatness.", "TG": "(Liam Davis was born in Austin) starts at 1972\n(Liam Davis played for Phoenix Eagles junior soccer team) starts at 1988\n(Liam Davis played for Seattle Warriors under-17 football team) starts at 1989\n(Liam Davis played for Cheshire national under-16 football team) starts at 1989\n(Liam Davis played for Phoenix Eagles junior soccer team) ends at 1990\n(Liam Davis played for R.W.

She grew up surrounded by the charm and tranquility of the ocean, with the sound of seagulls and the scent of salty air always lingering in her childhood memories.\n\nIn the neighboring town of Meadowville, Molly Oliver came into the world in 1944. She was a spirited and adventurous girl, always seeking new experiences and eager to explore the world beyond her peaceful hometown.\n\nAs fate would have it, Molly ended up meeting a young man named Harry Reynolds. They fell deeply in love and decided to tie the knot in 1968. Their love blossomed and their marriage brought joy to their lives, filling each day with laughter and shared dreams.\n\nHowever, sometimes life takes unexpected turns. Molly and Harry's love story faced a difficult chapter, and their marriage came to an end in 1978. Though their union may have ended, the memories they shared together would forever be a part of their souls.\n\nIn the midst of Molly and Harry's separation, Oliver Buckley, a resident of Harrison, entered their lives in 1981. Oliver was a kind and gentle soul who had always admired Harry from afar. Fate brought Oliver and Harry together, and soon, their friendship bloomed into love. They decided to unite their lives in marriage, vowing to support and cherish one another.\n\nTheir love story, however, had its own challenges. The year 1990 marked the end of Oliver and Harry's marriage, but their bond remained unbreakable. Their shared experiences and the love they once held dear would forever be etched in their hearts.\n\nBy the turn of the millennium in 2000, Molly and Emily found solace in each other. They discovered that their friendship could blossom into something much deeper, a connection forged through shared experiences and the understanding of a lifetime. They decided to embark on a journey of love and commitment, vowing to stand by each other's side through thick and thin.\n\nAs life continued to unfold, Oliver Buckley, who had relocated to Denver, bid farewell to this world in 2013, leaving behind cherished memories and a legacy of love.\n\nThe lives of Emily Foster, Molly Oliver, Harry Reynolds, and Oliver Buckley were intertwined by a complex web of love, loss, and resilience. Despite the challenges they faced, their stories serve as a reminder that love knows no boundaries or limitations. It can transcend time, overcome hardships, and lead us to unexpected places, where our hearts find solace and our souls find home.", "TG": "(Emily Foster was born in Oceanview) starts at 1941\n(Molly Oliver was born in Meadowville) starts at 1944\n(Oliver Buckley was born in Harrison) starts at 1944\n(Molly Oliver was married to Harry Reynolds) starts at 1968\n(Harry Reynolds was married to Molly Oliver) starts at 1968\n(Molly Oliver was married to Harry Reynolds) ends at 1978\n(Harry Reynolds was married to Molly Oliver) ends at 1978\n(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds) starts at 1981\n(Harry Reynolds was married to Oliver Buckley) starts at 1981\n(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds) ends at 1990\n(Harry Reynolds was married to Oliver Buckley) ends at 1990\n(Molly Oliver was married to Emily Foster) starts at 2000\n(Emily Foster was married to Molly Oliver) starts at 2000\n(Oliver Buckley died in Denver) starts at 2013\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Molly Oliver was born in Meadowville) or (Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Molly Oliver was born in Meadowville)", "(Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Foster was married to Molly Oliver) or (Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)?", "C": ["(Emily Foster was married to Molly Oliver)", "(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Reynolds was married to Molly Oliver) or (Oliver Buckley was born in Harrison)?", "C": ["(Harry Reynolds was married to Molly Oliver)", "(Oliver Buckley was born in Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Molly Oliver was married to Harry Reynolds) or (Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Molly Oliver was married to Harry Reynolds)", "(Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Harry Reynolds was married to Oliver Buckley) or (Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Harry Reynolds was married to Oliver Buckley)", "(Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Buckley died in Denver) or (Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)?", "C": ["(Oliver Buckley died in Denver)", "(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Molly Oliver was born in Meadowville) or (Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)?", "C": ["(Molly Oliver was born in Meadowville)", "(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Foster was born in Oceanview) or (Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)?", "C": ["(Emily Foster was born in Oceanview)", "(Oliver Buckley was married to Harry Reynolds)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Molly Oliver was married to Harry Reynolds), (Emily Foster was married to Molly Oliver), (Oliver Buckley died in Denver), (Molly Oliver was married to Emily Foster), (Emily Foster was born in Oceanview).

born in 1945. From a young age, it was clear that Lily possessed a unique gift for singing. Her voice resonated through the streets of the town, captivating anyone who had the pleasure of listening.\n\nA couple of years later, in 1947, a boy named Ethan Thompson was born in the nearby town of Redmond. Little did Lily or Ethan know that their paths would cross later in life.\n\nIt wasn't until 1949 when another musical prodigy, Alex Thompson, graced the world with his presence in Northampton, Massachusetts. Alex's voice was simply enchanting, and his passion for music burned bright within him.\n\nIn 1969, Lily Roberts and Ethan Thompson made a vow to spend their lives together, bound by love and their shared dreams. They embarked on a beautiful journey, supporting each other through the highs and lows, and always finding solace in their love for music.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans in store. In 1976, Alex Thompson entered Lily's life, breaking the harmony she had found with Ethan. Their connection was undeniable, and the two musicians found solace in each other's melodies. The world watched as their voices intertwined, creating stunning harmonies that resonated deeply within the hearts of their listeners.\n\nBut love is a complex dance, and in the same year, 1976, Lily returned to Ethan, ending her brief rendezvous with Alex. Their chapter closed as swiftly as it had begun.\n\nYears passed, and in 1982, another unexpected twist unfurled. Emily Johnson, a young woman with an unwavering passion for music, entered Alex Thompson's life. They fell madly in love, their voices blending effortlessly, like two souls linked by an invisible thread.\n\nEmily and Alex were married, their union bringing newfound happiness and inspiration to their music. Their voices intertwined in perfect harmony, captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily Roberts found her way back into Ethan's arms in 1982, rekindling their love and reigniting the flame of their shared dreams. Music still remained their sanctuary, an eternal reminder of the connective power they had always shared.\n\nYears turned into decades, and in 2000, both Emily and Alex's marriage and Lily and Ethan's marriage came to an end. It wasn't fueled by hate or animosity but rather by a mutual understanding that sometimes, two souls simply grow apart.\n\nAs the curtains fell on these chapters of their lives, Lily, Ethan, Alex, and Emily had each left an indelible mark on the world of music. Their voices echoed through time, their stories forever etched in the hearts of those who had been touched by their melodies.\n\nThough their paths had diverged, their love for music remained the common thread that defined them. And as they ventured forth into the unknown, they carried the echoes of their shared past, forever intertwined in the symphony of life.", "TG": "(Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut) starts at 1945\n(Emily Johnson was born in Redmond) starts at 1947\n(Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts) starts at 1949\n(Lily Roberts was married to Ethan Thompson) starts at 1969\n(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts) starts at 1976\n(Lily Roberts was married to Ethan Thompson) ends at 1976\n(Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer)) starts at 1982\n(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson) starts at 1982\n(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts) ends at 1982\n(Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer)) ends at 2000\n(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson) ends at 2000\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Roberts was married to Ethan Thompson) or (Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer))?", "C": ["(Lily Roberts was married to Ethan Thompson)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts) or (Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts)", "(Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson) or (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts)?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson)", "(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts) or (Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer))?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Alex Thompson (singer))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson) or (Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson)", "(Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut) or (Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)", "(Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut) or (Emily Johnson was born in Redmond)?", "C": ["(Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut)", "(Emily Johnson was born in Redmond)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts) or (Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts)", "(Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts) or (Emily Johnson was born in Redmond)?", "C": ["(Alex Thompson (singer) was born in Northampton, Massachusetts)", "(Emily Johnson was born in Redmond)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Emily Johnson), (Emily Johnson was born in Redmond), (Lily Roberts was married to Ethan Thompson), (Alex Thompson (singer) was married to Lily Roberts), (Lily Roberts was born in Bristol, Connecticut).

At the same time, in the nearby city of Riverside, Liam Collins came into the world. Little did they know, their paths would intertwine in the most unexpected ways.\n\nFast forward to 1914, and in the vibrant city of Atlanta, Sophia Thompson was born. Fate had something special in store for her, as her life would eventually intersect with both Emily and Liam.\n\nIn 1943, a momentous event unfolded as Emily Anderson and Liam Collins found themselves drawn together in the sacred bond of marriage. Their love blossomed in unimaginable ways, filling their lives with joy and countless cherished memories. Their union brought them great happiness and contentment for four blissful years.\n\nHowever, in 1947, their incredible journey as husband and wife came to an end. The world seemed a little colder as Emily and Liam decided to part ways. Their time together had been magical, but sometimes even the strongest love stories reach their conclusion.\n\nJust a year later, in 1948, Liam Collins found himself captivated by the enchanting presence of Sophia Thompson. Love had a funny way of healing hearts, and Liam, while still carrying the memories of his time with Emily, allowed himself to be swept away once again. Sophia became the new beacon of light in his life as they embarked on their own romantic adventure.\n\nYears passed, and in 1976, Liam Collins sadly departed from this world in Manchester, New Hampshire. His legacy was one of love and commitment, having left his mark on the lives of both Emily Anderson and Sophia Thompson. Liam had experienced profound love twice in his lifetime, leaving behind a legacy of kindness and devotion.\n\nSophia's journey continued, and in 1982, she too bid her final farewell in her birthplace, Atlanta.

baby named Jaxon Dixon was born in 1935. As fate would have it, Jaxon would go on to have a remarkable life, intertwined with the lives of two other individuals.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Springfield, a young boy named Jake J. Bennett came into the world in 1951. Little did he know that his path would cross with Jaxon's in the years to come.\n\nFurther down the line, in the peaceful town of Harmonyville, a girl named Sophia Clark was born in 1961. Little Sophia grew up with a sense of adventure and a knack for finding her way into unexpected situations.\n\nIn 1964, destiny brought Jaxon and Sophia together, and they were joined in a loving marriage. Their lives were filled with joy and laughter, and they were fortunate enough to witness the birth of their only child.\n\nMeanwhile, Springfield underwent an exciting change when Moss Field came under its ownership in 1965. The sprawling sports facility became a hub of activity and brought the community closer together.\n\nHowever, fate took an unexpected turn in 1969, as Jaxon and Sophia decided to part ways. They bid each other farewell with heavy hearts, leaving their once-shared life behind.\n\nNot long after their separation, Sophia found solace in the arms of another man named Miles Gibson in 1975. They embarked on a new chapter, creating beautiful memories together. Meanwhile, Springfield made the difficult decision to relinquish ownership of Moss Field in the same year, leaving behind a legacy of thrilling sporting events.\n\nSurprisingly, destiny had other plans for Jaxon and Sophia, as they discovered their deep love for each other once again in 1986. They couldn't resist the undeniable pull and decided to give their relationship another chance.\n\nTheir reunion was filled with joy and a newfound appreciation for each other. They made up for lost time and rekindled the flame that had once burned so brightly between them. Through the ups and downs of life, they remained steadfast in their commitment to one another.\n\nDuring this time, in 1973, Jake J. Bennett pursued his dreams of higher education and studied at Greenfield College. He immersed himself in his studies, nurturing his passion for learning and personal growth.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and fate weaved its intricate tapestry once again. Sophia, now a mature and beautiful woman, found herself drawn to Jake J. Bennett. Their connection was immediate, as if the universe had conspired to bring them together.\n\nIn a whirlwind romance, Sophia and Jake J. Bennett decided to embrace the love that had blossomed between them. Their bond felt undeniable, and they embarked on a new journey hand in hand.\n\nAnd so, the lives of Jaxon Dixon, Sophia Clark, and Jake J. Bennett intertwined in a series of remarkable events, showing that love and destiny are often full of surprises. They faced triumphs and tribulations, but ultimately found solace and happiness where they least expected it.", "TG": "(Jaxon Dixon was born in Boston) starts at 1935\n(Jake J.

He grew up to be a charismatic and charming young man, known for his kind heart and love for adventure.\n\nIn 1937, in the vibrant city of Denver, another child came into the world. Megan Riley, a beautiful and ambitious girl, had a fiery spirit that matched her striking personality.\n\nAs fate would have it, their paths crossed in the year 1940 when they both found themselves in the lovely city of Seattle. Emily Johnson, a vivacious and intelligent young woman, was born and raised there. Her passion for the arts and her warm smile attracted many admirers, including Prince William.\n\nThe year 1955 marked a significant turning point in their lives, as Emily Johnson and Prince William of Lancaster decided to embark on a journey together. They exchanged vows of love and commitment, celebrating the start of their life as a married couple.\n\nHowever, their love story was not meant to last. By 1960, difficulties began to arise, and both Emily and Prince William realized that their paths had diverged. With heavy hearts, they made the hard decision to part ways and end their marriage.\n\nYears passed, and in 1973, fate intervened once more. Megan Riley, a successful and confident woman, caught the attention of Prince William. Their connection was immediate, and they soon found themselves walking down the aisle, ready to face whatever challenges life threw at them.\n\nFor the next twelve years, Megan and Prince William shared a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure. However, as the year 1985 arrived, they knew that their chapter together had come to an end. With gratitude for the memories they had created, they bid each other farewell and went their separate ways.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2002, an unexpected event brought a twist to this tale. It was discovered that the charming town of Portland had become the proud owner of the iconic Wembley Stadium. This acquisition brought newfound glory and fame to Portland, as sports enthusiasts from around the world flocked to witness the thrilling events held within its magnificent walls.\n\nThe ownership of Wembley Stadium became a source of pride for the people of Portland and a symbol of their prosperity. Year after year, the stadium thrived and attracted countless visitors, contributing to the town's growth and thriving economy.\n\nAnd so, as the year 2017 drew to a close, the story of Prince William, Emily Johnson, Megan Riley, and the town of Portland continued to unravel. Though their lives had taken different paths, the impact they had on each other and the world around them remained forever etched in history.", "TG": "(Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland) starts at 1924\n(Megan Riley was born in Denver) starts at 1937\n(Emily Johnson was born in Seattle) starts at 1940\n(Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster) starts at 1955\n(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson) starts at 1955\n(Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster) ends at 1960\n(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson) ends at 1960\n(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley) starts at 1973\n(Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster) starts at 1973\n(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley) ends at 1985\n(Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster) ends at 1985\n(Portland owned Wembley Stadium) starts at 2002\n(Portland owned Wembley Stadium) ends at 2017\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson) or (Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson)", "(Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Riley was born in Denver) or (Portland owned Wembley Stadium)?", "C": ["(Megan Riley was born in Denver)", "(Portland owned Wembley Stadium)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Portland owned Wembley Stadium) or (Emily Johnson was born in Seattle)?", "C": ["(Portland owned Wembley Stadium)", "(Emily Johnson was born in Seattle)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster) or (Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster)", "(Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was born in Seattle) or (Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was born in Seattle)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Riley was born in Denver) or (Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Megan Riley was born in Denver)", "(Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley) or (Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)?", "C": ["(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley)", "(Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley) or (Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson)?", "C": ["(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley)", "(Prince William of Lancaster was married to Emily Johnson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland) or (Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster)?", "C": ["(Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland)", "(Megan Riley was married to Prince William of Lancaster)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Prince William of Lancaster was born in Portland), (Portland owned Wembley Stadium), (Prince William of Lancaster was married to Megan Riley), (Megan Riley was born in Denver), (Emily Johnson was married to Prince William of Lancaster).

Growing up, David had a deep passion for painting and expressing himself through art. Little did he know that his artistic journey would intertwine with the lives of two individuals who would become significant figures in his life.\n\nIn the year 1917, another child was born in the small town of Glenville. This child, named Henry Carver, would grow up to become a charismatic and ambitious individual. Though different from David in many ways, they shared a common love for creativity and self-expression.\n\nYears passed, and in 1921, a young boy named Liam Mitchell was born in the vibrant city of San Francisco. Liam, like David and Henry, possessed a remarkable talent for art. As fate would have it, their paths would cross, and a bond would form between the three kindred spirits.\n\nTime moved swiftly, and in 1941, Henry Carver and Liam Mitchell decided to take their friendship to the next level. They became life partners, supporting each other's dreams and ambitions. Their love and dedication for each other were evident to everyone around them.\n\nDuring this same year, David Carson found love of his own. He tied the knot with a woman named Sophie Mitchell, who happened to be Liam's sister. Their love for each other seemed to flow effortlessly, as if destiny had planned their union.\n\nHowever, life is unpredictable, and sometimes love takes unexpected turns. In 1948, the love story between Henry and Liam came to an end. Their partnership took a different course, but their bond remained unbreakable, even if they were no longer romantically involved.\n\nIn the year 1950, Liam Mitchell found love in the most unexpected place\u2014 with David Carson, his former partner's dear friend. It seemed that destiny had orchestrated their paths to cross once again. United by their shared love for art and creativity, Liam and David started a new chapter filled with love, understanding, and support.\n\nThe years rolled on, and in 1959, tragedy struck when David Carson passed away in his hometown of Willowdale. Liam Mitchell, who had been by his side throughout their journey, bid a tearful farewell to the love of his life. Their love had created a timeless bond that could never be erased.\n\nFast forward to 1990, when Henry Carver took his last breath in the bustling city of Atlanta. Known for his charisma and vibrant personality, he had left an indelible mark on the lives he had touched. His legacy as an artist and a dear friend lived on in the memories of those who knew him.\n\nLastly, in 2004, Liam Mitchell, the artist who had experienced love, loss, and everything in between, peacefully left the world in the serene setting of Oceanview. His artistic spirit and the passion he had shared with David and Henry continued to inspire generations to come.\n\nThus, the lives of David Carson, Henry Carver, and Liam Mitchell had been entwined through art, love, and friendship. Their journey reminds us that love can manifest in various forms and that true connections go beyond the bounds of time and circumstance.", "TG": "(David Carson (artist) was born in Springfield) starts at 1907\n(Henry Carver was born in Glenville) starts at 1917\n(Liam Mitchell was born in San Francisco) starts at 1921\n(Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell) starts at 1941\n(Liam Mitchell was married to Henry Carver) starts at 1941\n(Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell) ends at 1948\n(Liam Mitchell was married to Henry Carver) ends at 1948\n(Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist)) starts at 1950\n(David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell) starts at 1950\n(David Carson (artist) died in Willowdale) starts at 1959\n(Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist)) ends at 1959\n(Henry Carver died in Atlanta) starts at 1990\n(Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview) starts at 2004\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell) or (Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell)", "(Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell) or (Henry Carver was born in Glenville)?", "C": ["(Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell)", "(Henry Carver was born in Glenville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Carson (artist) died in Willowdale) or (David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell)?", "C": ["(David Carson (artist) died in Willowdale)", "(David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell) or (Henry Carver died in Atlanta)?", "C": ["(David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell)", "(Henry Carver died in Atlanta)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell) or (Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist))?", "C": ["(Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell)", "(Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview) or (Liam Mitchell was married to Henry Carver)?", "C": ["(Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)", "(Liam Mitchell was married to Henry Carver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell) or (David Carson (artist) was born in Springfield)?", "C": ["(David Carson (artist) was married to Liam Mitchell)", "(David Carson (artist) was born in Springfield)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist)) or (Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist))", "(Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview) or (David Carson (artist) was born in Springfield)?", "C": ["(Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview)", "(David Carson (artist) was born in Springfield)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Henry Carver died in Atlanta), (Liam Mitchell died in Oceanview), (David Carson (artist) died in Willowdale), (Henry Carver was married to Liam Mitchell), (Liam Mitchell was married to David Carson (artist)).

Oliver Collins was born in the year 1875. He grew up surrounded by the awe-inspiring beauty of the Pacific Northwest, where the rugged coastline and towering forests provided endless adventures.\n\nYears later, in the quaint town of Morristown, North Carolina, a girl named Megan Thompson was born in 1895. Growing up in the charming southern town, Megan developed a vibrant spirit and a love for the warm hospitality of her community.\n\nAs fate would have it, the paths of Oliver and Megan crossed in the year 1920. Their meeting was magical, as if the universe had gently nudged them together. Recognizing something extraordinary in each other, they soon fell deeply in love. Their bond grew stronger with each passing day, and they knew they were destined to spend their lives together.\n\nIn 1935, after fifteen blissful years of marriage, their love story took an unexpected turn. Megan Thompson, now Megan Collins, bid farewell to this world, leaving Oliver heartbroken and longing for her warmth and laughter. In the midst of his sorrow, Oliver held tight to their cherished memories and the profound love they shared.\n\nA decade later, in 1946, Oliver Collins found solace in the picturesque city of Riverside, California. Though his heart still ached for his beloved Megan, the allure of the vibrant city and its sunny skies brought some much-needed joy to his life. Oliver built a new home, surrounded by gardens blooming with vibrant colors, reminiscent of the love they once shared.\n\nLife continued its journey, and in 1965, Megan Thompson, now a memory enshrined in Oliver's heart, completed her earthly voyage in Dallas. The news reached Oliver, and he felt a deep pang of sadness, knowing that another piece of their story had come to an end.\n\nAs Oliver reflected on the tapestry of their lives, he realized that love is a timeless force, transcending boundaries of time and space. Even though Megan and Oliver were no longer physically intertwined, their souls remained forever entwined.\n\nIn the twilight years of his life, Oliver found solace in the memories of their enchanting love story. He often reminisced about their early years, from the wild adventures of their youth to building a life filled with profound love and understanding. Their love had been a journey, full of highs and lows, and Oliver cherished every moment of it.\n\nAnd so, as the chapters of their lives closed, Oliver Collins carried their love with him, a beacon of light guiding him through the remaining days of his existence. Their story reminded him that love, in its purest form, knows no bounds and, even in the face of loss, can bring warmth and solace to the deepest corners of one's soul.", "TG": "(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon) starts at 1875\n(Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina) starts at 1895\n(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins) starts at 1920\n(Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson) starts at 1920\n(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins) ends at 1935\n(Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson) ends at 1935\n(Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California) starts at 1946\n(Megan Thompson died in Dallas) starts at 1965\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins) or (Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins)", "(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins) or (Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)?", "C": ["(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins)", "(Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon) or (Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)", "(Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California) or (Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California)", "(Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California) or (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California)", "(Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson) or (Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson)", "(Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon) or (Megan Thompson died in Dallas)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)", "(Megan Thompson died in Dallas)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California) or (Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California)", "(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson) or (Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson)", "(Oliver Collins was born in Astoria, Oregon)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California) or (Megan Thompson died in Dallas)?", "C": ["(Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California)", "(Megan Thompson died in Dallas)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver Collins died in Riverside, California), (Megan Thompson was married to Oliver Collins), (Megan Thompson was born in Morristown, North Carolina), (Oliver Collins was married to Megan Thompson), (Megan Thompson died in Dallas).

"Once upon a time in the small town of Glenville, a talented young soccer player named Michael Johnson was born in 1981. From a very early age, Michael's love for the sport was evident, and he was determined to make a name for himself on the field.\n\nAt the age of 16, Michael joined the Crimsonville national under-16 soccer club, showcasing his skills and catching the attention of scouts. In 1998, he also joined Liverpool United's under-20 soccer team, where he flourished and honed his abilities. Michael's dedication and hard work paid off, as he became a key player for Liverpool United.\n\nHowever, his time with Liverpool United came to an end in 1999, as he decided to explore other opportunities. Joining the Arizona City national under-18 football team that same year, Michael continued to showcase his exceptional talent. Always seeking new challenges, he joined Bloomington Wanderers in the same year.\n\nDuring his time with Bloomington Wanderers, Michael's skills and reputation grew immensely. But in 2000, he decided to embark on a new adventure and signed with Thunderclap United, proving his worth in yet another team. Soon after, he was offered a position at Chelsea United, a prestigious club that further cemented his status as a remarkable player.\n\nHowever, Michael's time at Bloomington Wanderers and Thunderclap United came to an end in 2000. Seeking fresh experiences, he joined Storm City F.C., where he showcased his versatility on the field. However, after a successful stint with Storm City, Michael decided to part ways in 2003, bidding farewell to yet another team.\n\nBut Michael's journey didn't end there. In 2002, he signed a contract with Clarkstown Eagles, demonstrating his skills and commitment once again. However, his time with Clarkstown Eagles came to a close in 2003, and he joined Grand Rapids Knights later that year.\n\nFor the next few years, Michael played for Grand Rapids Knights, leaving an indelible mark on the team and their fans. However, seeking new challenges, he joined Riverdale United in 2006. Although he had a brief stint with Riverdale United, his impact was great.\n\nIn 2008, Michael found himself signing with Warwick United, dedicating his skills to the team for a year before moving on to Manchester United in 2009. This move brought Michael tremendous success, as he played a crucial role in the team's victories.\n\nHowever, his time with Manchester United was short-lived, as he decided to join Valley United in 2010. Michael's talent and passion for the game shone brightly during his time with Valley United, and he continued to impress fans and pundits alike.\n\nBut alas, in 2011, Michael decided to retire from professional soccer, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy as one of the most gifted players of his generation. His journey from Glenville to playing for numerous renowned clubs was a testament to his dedication, perseverance, and innate talent. Though his time on the field had come to an end, Michael Johnson's name would forever be remembered in the annals of soccer history.", "TG": "(Michael Johnson was born in Glenville) starts at 1981\n(Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) starts at 1998\n(Michael Johnson played for Crimsonville national under-16 soccer club) starts at 1998\n(Michael Johnson played for Arizona City national under-18 football team) starts at 1999\n(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers) starts at 1999\n(Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) ends at 1999\n(Michael Johnson played for Thunderclap United) starts at 2000\n(Michael Johnson played for Chelsea United) starts at 2000\n(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers) ends at 2000\n(Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.) starts at 2000\n(Michael Johnson played for Arizona City national under-18 football team) ends at 2000\n(Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles) starts at 2002\n(Michael Johnson played for Thunderclap United) ends at 2002\n(Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.) ends at 2003\n(Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles) ends at 2003\n(Michael Johnson played for Grand Rapids Knights) starts at 2003\n(Michael Johnson played for Riverdale United) starts at 2006\n(Michael Johnson played for Grand Rapids Knights) ends at 2006\n(Michael Johnson played for Riverdale United) ends at 2008\n(Michael Johnson played for Warwick United) starts at 2008\n(Michael Johnson played for Warwick United) ends at 2009\n(Michael Johnson played for Manchester United) starts at 2009\n(Michael Johnson played for Valley United) starts at 2010\n(Michael Johnson played for Manchester United) ends at 2010\n(Michael Johnson played for Valley United) ends at 2011\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) or (Michael Johnson played for Riverdale United)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)", "(Michael Johnson played for Riverdale United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.) or (Michael Johnson played for Valley United)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.)", "(Michael Johnson played for Valley United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers) or (Michael Johnson played for Valley United)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)", "(Michael Johnson played for Valley United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.) or (Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.)", "(Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Chelsea United) or (Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Chelsea United)", "(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) or (Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)", "(Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Manchester United) or (Michael Johnson played for Grand Rapids Knights)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Manchester United)", "(Michael Johnson played for Grand Rapids Knights)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson was born in Glenville) or (Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson was born in Glenville)", "(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers) or (Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Bloomington Wanderers)", "(Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson played for Warwick United) or (Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson played for Warwick United)", "(Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Johnson played for Thunderclap United), (Michael Johnson played for Clarkstown Eagles), (Michael Johnson was born in Glenville), (Michael Johnson played for Storm City F.C.), (Michael Johnson played for Chelsea United).

From an early age, George had a deep passion for soccer and dreamt of playing on the big stage one day.\n\nIn 1998, at the age of eight, George joined the local soccer team called United Tigers. His skills and determination quickly caught the attention of his coaches, and he continued to excel on the field throughout his time with the team.\n\nGeorge's talent did not go unnoticed, and in 2006, at the age of sixteen, he earned a spot on Liverpool United's under-20 soccer team. His time with the prestigious club was short-lived, however, as he made a move to join Newcastle United football club in 2007.\n\nAlthough George's time at Newcastle United was relatively brief, he made the most of his opportunity and showcased his immense potential. Unfortunately, he parted ways with the club in 2009, but it did not deter his spirit.\n\nIn 2010, George joined Riverside United, a team known for its dedication and passion. He had a successful stint with them before moving on to play for Oceanside United FC in 2011. George's skills continued to evolve, and in 2012, he joined Lionheart FC, where he displayed his true potential over the course of a year.\n\nFollowing his impressive performances with Lionheart FC, George received an incredible opportunity to join Blackburn Rovers in 2015. The prestigious club provided him with the platform to further develop his skills, and he made a remarkable impact on the field during his time there.\n\nIn 2016, George embarked on a new journey as he joined Purple Tigers, a team known for its vibrant spirit and dedication to the game. He continued to mesmerize audiences with his incredible talent.\n\nFrom his humble beginnings in Greenwood to the bright lights of professional soccer, George Thompson's story is a testament to his unwavering dedication, perseverance, and love for the game. His journey reminds us that with passion, determination, and the right opportunities, dreams can come true.", "TG": "(George Thompson was born in Greenwood) starts at 1990\n(George Thompson played for United Tigers) starts at 1998\n(George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) starts at 2006\n(George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club) starts at 2007\n(George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) ends at 2007\n(George Thompson played for Hillside United F.C.) starts at 2007\n(George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team) starts at 2009\n(George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club) ends at 2009\n(George Thompson played for Riverside United) starts at 2010\n(George Thompson played for Hillside United F.C.) ends at 2010\n(George Thompson played for Oceanside United FC) starts at 2011\n(George Thompson played for Riverside United) ends at 2012\n(George Thompson played for Lionheart FC) starts at 2012\n(George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers) starts at 2015\n(George Thompson played for Purple Tigers) starts at 2016\n(George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers) ends at 2016\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Lionheart FC) or (George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Lionheart FC)", "(George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) or (George Thompson played for Riverside United)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)", "(George Thompson played for Riverside United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers) or (George Thompson played for Purple Tigers)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers)", "(George Thompson played for Purple Tigers)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club) or (George Thompson played for Riverside United)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club)", "(George Thompson played for Riverside United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team) or (George Thompson was born in Greenwood)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)", "(George Thompson was born in Greenwood)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team) or (George Thompson played for Riverside United)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)", "(George Thompson played for Riverside United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers) or (George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers)", "(George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team) or (George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team)", "(George Thompson played for Newcastle United football club)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for United Tigers) or (George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for United Tigers)", "(George Thompson played for Liverpool national under-20 football team)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (George Thompson played for Oceanside United FC) or (George Thompson played for Riverside United)?", "C": ["(George Thompson played for Oceanside United FC)", "(George Thompson played for Riverside United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (George Thompson played for Purple Tigers), (George Thompson played for Riverside United), (George Thompson played for Liverpool United under-20 soccer team), (George Thompson played for United Tigers), (George Thompson played for Blackburn Rovers).

in the year 1940. John grew up in a loving family, surrounded by the melodious tunes of music, which would later become his passion and legacy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the nearby city of Springfield, another child named Amy Snyder came into this world in 1945. Amy was raised in a musical household as well, and her soul resonated with the harmonies that filled her home.\n\nAs fate would have it, John and Amy's paths crossed when they were just teenagers. They instantly connected over their shared love for music and the limitless possibilities it held. In 1960, they decided to take a leap of faith and tie the knot, embarking on a beautiful journey together.\n\nTheir love story began to blossom, and John's musical talents garnered attention from all corners of the world. The fame and success of The Beatles propelled them into a whirlwind of concerts, tours, and endless adoration. Along this wild ride, Amy stood firmly by John's side, offering comfort, support, and unwavering love.\n\nHowever, as the years went by, the pressures of fame began to take a toll on their relationship. The constant spotlight and scrutiny left very little room for personal growth and tranquility. Eventually, in 1964, with bittersweet hearts, John and Amy decided to go their separate ways, choosing a path that would allow them to rediscover themselves.\n\nYears passed, and both John and Amy found solace in their individual journeys. Amy focused on her own music career, striving to express her voice and talent. In 1967, she found happiness and companionship once again when she married a kind-hearted soul named John Lennon. It was a coincidence that they shared the same first and last names, but it brought an uncanny sense of serendipity and joy to their lives.\n\nDespite their shared names, this new John and Amy cherished their unique connection and embraced every moment with gratitude. They created a life enriched with love, laughter, and an unwavering support for each other's dreams.\n\nSadly, tragedy struck in 1993 when John Lennon, the legendary musician from The Beatles, passed away in the peaceful town of Oceanview. Amy was devastated by the loss of her husband and the love they had built together over the years.

Anderson was born in the year 1984. From a very young age, it was clear that John had a knack for football. He could often be found kicking a ball around in the park with his friends, displaying incredible talent and determination.\n\nAs John grew older, his skills on the field continued to impress. In the year 2000, he received an incredible opportunity to play for the San Francisco Dragons, a professional football team. This marked the beginning of his professional career, and John was ecstatic to showcase his abilities on a bigger stage.\n\nThe following year, in 2001, John's potential caught the attention of the national under-19 football team, the Crimson Tigers. He was selected to represent his country, bringing immense pride to his family and hometown. With John's skills and dedication, the team achieved notable successes.\n\nDespite his early success with the San Francisco Dragons, John decided to explore new horizons and joined the Vancouver Dribblers in 2002. He brought his wealth of experience and expertise to the team, making significant contributions on the field.\n\nHowever, John's time with the Crimson Tigers came to an end in 2002. He had given his all to the national under-19 team, leaving behind a remarkable legacy and cherished memories.\n\nIn 2003, John's football journey took yet another turn as he joined the Caspian national under-21 football team. Representing his country once again, he embraced the challenge and wholeheartedly dedicated himself to the sport he loved.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, John made a comeback in 2007, this time joining the esteemed Storm City F.C. His time with the team was memorable, but it came to an end that same year when he decided to rejoin the Vancouver Dribblers. The fans rejoiced, welcoming their beloved player back with open arms.\n\nIn the year 2009, a massive opportunity presented itself to John.

"Once upon a time, in the year 1975, a talented young boy named Sammy Mitchell was born in the beautiful town of Jupiter. From an early age, it was clear that Sammy had a passion for football, and he dreamed of making it big in the world of soccer.\n\nIn 1988, Sammy's skills caught the attention of a local team called United Tigers. He joined their youth academy and began honing his abilities on the field. With each passing year, Sammy's talent grew, and his dedication paid off.\n\nBy 1992, Sammy was selected to represent the prestigious Arizona City national under-18 football team. He wore their colors proudly and made a name for himself with his exceptional gameplay. During the same year, Sammy was scouted by Newcastle United football club, renowned for nurturing young talents.\n\nLeaving United Tigers behind in 1993, Sammy embraced a new challenge with VQ Malvern Wanderers. The club provided him with valuable experiences and shaped him into a more well-rounded player. However, it was during this time that his journey with the Arizona City national under-18 team came to an end.\n\nIn 1995, Sammy Mitchell found himself donning the jersey of Blue Thunder United. This phase marked a significant turning point in his career. His skills continued to impress, capturing the attention of the mighty Manchester United in 1996. Sammy's dream of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world had come true.\n\nNevertheless, his time with VQ Malvern Wanderers and Blue Thunder United was short-lived, as he moved on to join the Avalon Maroons in 1998. Life at Avalon was a fruitful period for Sammy, and he relished every moment, but in 1999, he bid farewell to the Maroons and embarked on a new adventure with Riverdale United.\n\nIn the year 2000, Sammy played for Hillside United, where he showcased his leadership skills and determination on the field. As fate would have it, his stint with Riverdale United came to an end the same year. However, Sammy's spirit remained unbroken, and he knew there were more exciting chapters in store for him.\n\nA few years passed, and in 2003, Sammy Mitchell found himself joining the ranks of Lionheart FC. The team became his family, and he poured his heart and soul into every game. But in 2004, it was time to move on, and Sammy joined Sunset Town FC where he continued to excel.\n\nSammy's time at Sunset Town FC lasted until 2007 when he decided to retire from professional football. Throughout his career, he had experienced the highs and lows, tasted victory and faced defeat. But most importantly, he had left a lasting impact on the teams he had represented.\n\nToday, Sammy Mitchell's legacy lives on in the hearts of those who witnessed his incredible journey. His story serves as an inspiration to young footballers, reminding them that with passion, hard work, and determination, dreams can come true.", "TG": "(Sammy Mitchell was born in Jupiter) starts at 1975\n(Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers) starts at 1988\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Arizona City national under-18 football team) starts at 1992\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Newcastle United football club) starts at 1992\n(Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers) ends at 1993\n(Sammy Mitchell played for VQ Malvern Wanderers) starts at 1993\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Arizona City national under-18 football team) ends at 1993\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Blue Thunder United) starts at 1995\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United) starts at 1996\n(Sammy Mitchell played for VQ Malvern Wanderers) ends at 1996\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Blue Thunder United) ends at 1996\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Avalon Maroons) starts at 1998\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United) ends at 1998\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Avalon Maroons) ends at 1999\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Riverdale United) starts at 1999\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Hillside United) starts at 2000\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Riverdale United) ends at 2000\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC) starts at 2003\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Hillside United) ends at 2004\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC) starts at 2004\n(Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC) ends at 2007\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Hillside United) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Hillside United)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for VQ Malvern Wanderers) or (Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for VQ Malvern Wanderers)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Newcastle United football club)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Newcastle United football club)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Newcastle United football club) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Avalon Maroons)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Newcastle United football club)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Avalon Maroons)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Sunset Town FC)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Blue Thunder United)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Blue Thunder United)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United) or (Sammy Mitchell was born in Jupiter)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Manchester United)", "(Sammy Mitchell was born in Jupiter)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for Arizona City national under-18 football team) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Riverdale United)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for Arizona City national under-18 football team)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Riverdale United)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers) or (Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)?", "C": ["(Sammy Mitchell played for United Tigers)", "(Sammy Mitchell played for Lionheart FC)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Sammy Mitchell played for Riverdale United), (Sammy Mitchell played for Arizona City national under-18 football team), (Sammy Mitchell played for Blue Thunder United), (Sammy Mitchell played for Avalon Maroons), (Sammy Mitchell played for Hillside United).

born in 1936. Growing up, Anthony had a happy childhood filled with laughter and love. Little did he know, destiny had a plan in store for him.\n\nMeanwhile, in the quaint town of Whiteville, North Carolina, a boy named Daniel S. Simmons arrived in 1939, bringing joy to his parents' hearts. Daniel had a curious nature and a love for exploration. As the years went by, he grew into a kind-hearted and adventurous young man.\n\nIn 1941, a girl named Jennifer Thompson came into the world in the enchanting village of Wanderers. Jennifer possessed a bright spirit and a sense of wonder that captivated those around her. She grew up in a close-knit community, surrounded by friends and family.\n\nThe paths of destiny intertwined when Jennifer and Daniel met in 1961. Instantly drawn to each other's magnetic personalities, they fell deeply in love. They decided to embark on the journey of marriage, promising to support and cherish one another.\n\nFor eight years, Jennifer and Daniel built a life together, facing the ups and downs that life inevitably brings. However, in 1969, their time together came to an end. They went their separate ways, parting with fond memories and grateful hearts.\n\nYears passed, and Anthony Harrison's life took an unexpected turn in 2002 when destiny brought Jennifer Thompson back into his life. Having never forgotten their past connection, Jennifer and Anthony decided to give love a second chance. They shared a joyous wedding, vowing to create new memories together.\n\nTheir love continued to grow, but fate had one final chapter in store. In 2015, tragedy struck as Jennifer passed away in the serene town of Kingston, Wyoming. The loss was devastating for Anthony, who held dear the memories they had shared.\n\nAnthony Harrison's heartache was immeasurable, yet he found solace in the profound love they had shared for thirteen beautiful years. They had experienced the highs and lows together, creating a lasting bond that would forever remain in his heart.\n\nThus concluded the story of Anthony Harrison and Jennifer Thompson, a tale of intertwined lives, lost and found love, and the enduring power of cherished memories.", "TG": "(Anthony Harrison was born in Edgewater, Illinois) starts at 1936\n(Daniel S.

Little did anyone know that this child would go on to become a significant figure in the world.\n\nJust a year later, in 1886, another life was brought into the world. Ella Collins, later known as Ella Collins the actress, was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia. With a natural talent for performing, Ella quickly found her passion in the world of acting.\n\nAs time went on, both John and Ella grew up separately, unaware of the future they would share. It wasn't until 1915 that their paths finally crossed. John, having made a name for himself in his respective field, and Ella, a rising star in the world of entertainment, fell deeply in love. The connection they had was undeniable, and they decided to embark on a journey together, tying the knot that same year.\n\nFor the next four years, John and Ella basked in the joys of their marriage. They traveled, attended glamorous events, and supported each other's dreams. However, as fate would have it, their incredible love story wasn't meant to last forever.\n\nIn 1919, their relationship took an unexpected turn. Ella and John faced challenges that ultimately led to their decision to part ways. Though their love for each other was undeniable, they both knew it was for the best. With heavy hearts, they bid each other farewell, marking the end of their time as husband and wife.\n\nThe years went by, and life moved on. Ella Collins, known as the beloved actress she had become, continued to captivate audiences with her talent. But tragedy struck in 1969 when Ella passed away in Riverside. The news shook the entertainment industry, and fans mourned the loss of the incredible talent they had come to admire.\n\nOn the other side of the story, John Smith continued to live his life, carrying the memories of his past. It wasn't until 1981, in the peaceful town of Brookville Heights, Boston, that John Smith passed away. He had left a lasting legacy, not just as a respected figure but as someone who had shared a remarkable love story with Ella Collins.\n\nThough their time together as a married couple had been relatively short, the impact of their relationship had touched the lives of many. John and Ella's story served as a reminder of the highs and lows love could bring, leaving behind a lasting impression that would never be forgotten.", "TG": "(John Smith was born in Glenville) starts at 1885\n(Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia) starts at 1886\n(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith) starts at 1915\n(John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress)) starts at 1915\n(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith) ends at 1919\n(John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress)) ends at 1919\n(Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside) starts at 1969\n(John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston) starts at 1981\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)?", "C": ["(John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside) or (John Smith was born in Glenville)?", "C": ["(Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)", "(John Smith was born in Glenville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress)) or (Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)?", "C": ["(John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress))", "(Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (John Smith was born in Glenville)?", "C": ["(John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(John Smith was born in Glenville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston) or (Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)?", "C": ["(John Smith died in Brookville Heights, Boston)", "(Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia) or (John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress))?", "C": ["(Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia)", "(John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress))"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia) or (Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)?", "C": ["(Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia)", "(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith) or (John Smith was born in Glenville)?", "C": ["(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)", "(John Smith was born in Glenville)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith) or (Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)?", "C": ["(Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith)", "(Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (John Smith was born in Glenville), (Ella Collins (actress) died in Riverside), (John Smith was married to Ella Collins (actress)), (Ella Collins (actress) was married to John Smith), (Ella Collins (actress) was born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia).

city of Jupiter. From an early age, Henry showed great potential and a curious mind that would shape his future.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in San Francisco, another young boy named Jack Bennett was born in 1974. Growing up in the culturally rich city, Jack was exposed to a myriad of influences that would later shape his artistic endeavors.\n\nAs fate would have it, Henry and Jack's paths would cross years later, bringing forth unexpected connections and friendships. In the year 1997, Henry Johnson tied the knot with a charming and talented individual named Oliver Thompson. Their marriage was not only a union of love but also a partnership of creative minds. Together, they explored new artistic territories and enriched each other's lives.\n\nInterestingly, Oliver Thompson had also been married to Henry Johnson around the same time. It was a unique circumstance that many found intriguing and filled with curiosity. It seemed as though destiny had intertwined these souls in a profound way.\n\nHowever, as life often presents unpredictable turns, Henry and Oliver's marriage came to an end in 2004. Despite the challenges and heartache, they both continued to pursue their passions and remained friends.\n\nIn the year 2008, a new chapter unfolded when Jack Bennett entered the picture. He fell head over heels in love with the talented Oliver Thompson, and they decided to embark on a journey of love and companionship. Their shared interests and artistic souls created a strong bond, leading to a beautiful marriage between Jack and Oliver.\n\nThroughout the years, these interconnected lives demonstrated the intricate dance of destiny.

She grew up in a loving family, filled with laughter and joy. As she blossomed into a beautiful young woman, her heart yearned for adventure and excitement beyond the familiar streets of Springfield.\n\nIn 1920, just a few years later, Dylan Anderson came into the world in the coastal town of Oceanview. He was raised by a single mother who instilled in him a strong sense of determination and independence. Dylan was always searching for something more, something beyond the confines of Oceanview.\n\nAs fate would have it, Mia and Dylan's paths crossed when they were both in their mid-twenties. Sparks flew instantly, and they knew deep within their souls that they had found something special in each other. In 1944, Mia and Dylan exchanged vows in a heartfelt ceremony, promising to love and support each other in sickness and in health.\n\nTheir love story seemed like something out of a fairy tale. Mia and Dylan were the epitome of a devoted couple, cherishing every moment together. They traveled the world side by side, exploring new places and embracing different cultures.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck in 1989 when Mia Scott passed away in Oceanview, her birthplace and the town she had always held dear to her heart. Her absence left a void in Dylan's life that could never be filled. With a heavy heart, he continued to carry the memories of their magical journey together.\n\nAlthough Dylan was devastated by Mia's passing, life still held adventures yet to be discovered. He found strength in honoring Mia's memory and celebrating the life they shared, never forgetting the love they had experienced.\n\nIn 1990, Dylan himself succumbed to the weight of his loss, peacefully leaving this world in Oceanview. As he took his last breath, a sense of contentment washed over him, knowing that he would soon be reunited with his beloved Mia.\n\nTheir extraordinary love story had come to an end, but their spirits would forever remain intertwined, dancing among the waves of Oceanview, where their journey had begun. And in the hearts of those who knew them, Mia Scott and Dylan Anderson would live on, inspiring others to seek love, adventure, and the magic that can be found in a single lifetime.", "TG": "(Mia Scott was born in Springfield) starts at 1914\n(Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview) starts at 1920\n(Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott) starts at 1944\n(Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson) starts at 1944\n(Mia Scott died in Oceanview) starts at 1989\n(Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott) ends at 1989\n(Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson) ends at 1989\n(Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview) starts at 1990\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Mia Scott died in Oceanview) or (Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Mia Scott died in Oceanview)", "(Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott) or (Mia Scott was born in Springfield)?", "C": ["(Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott)", "(Mia Scott was born in Springfield)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview) or (Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview)", "(Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott) or (Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott)", "(Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Mia Scott was born in Springfield) or (Mia Scott died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Mia Scott was born in Springfield)", "(Mia Scott died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Mia Scott was born in Springfield) or (Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson)?", "C": ["(Mia Scott was born in Springfield)", "(Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview) or (Mia Scott died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview)", "(Mia Scott died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson) or (Mia Scott died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson)", "(Mia Scott died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson) or (Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Mia Scott was married to Dylan Anderson)", "(Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Mia Scott died in Oceanview), (Dylan Anderson was born in Oceanview), (Mia Scott was born in Springfield), (Dylan Anderson was married to Mia Scott), (Dylan Anderson died in Oceanview).

Growing up, Oliver had an insatiable imagination and a passion for creating stories. Little did he know, his creative talents would lead him down a path of artistic brilliance.\n\nIn 1968, Oliver Walker conceived an iconic character named Liam 77. Liam 77 became an instant hit, captivating both young and old with his thrilling adventures. The success of Liam 77 motivated Oliver to push the boundaries of his creativity even further.\n\nIn 1970, Oliver Walker brought his vivid storytelling to the television screen with the creation of \"Spectra.\" This groundbreaking TV series mesmerized audiences, transporting them to new realms of wonder and mystery.\n\nAs time went on, Oliver continued to innovate. In 1984, he introduced the world to the exciting world of the \"Blackburn Bombers,\" a team of heroic individuals who fought against evil forces. Their bravery and determination inspired many.\n\nTwo years later, in 1986, Oliver introduced Samuel Holmes, an extraordinary detective who possessed an unmatched intellect and a keen eye for details. This character became an instant classic, capturing the hearts of readers and cementing Oliver's place in literary history.\n\nSadly, in 1993, Oliver Walker passed away in Eastwood, leaving behind a legacy that would be remembered for generations. His creative genius and imaginative endeavors touched the lives of countless individuals, forever altering the landscape of storytelling.\n\nThough Oliver may no longer be with us, his creations live on, influencing future generations of writers and artists. His stories continue to ignite the imaginations of readers and viewers, transporting them to worlds beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nAnd so, the legacy of Oliver Walker lives on, reminding us all of the power of storytelling and the magic it brings to our lives.", "TG": "(Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester) starts at 1934\n(Oliver Walker created Liam 77) starts at 1968\n(Oliver Walker created Spectra (TV series)) starts at 1970\n(Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers) starts at 1984\n(Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective) starts at 1986\n(Oliver Walker died in Eastwood) starts at 1993\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers) or (Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers)", "(Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers) or (Oliver Walker created Liam 77)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers)", "(Oliver Walker created Liam 77)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective) or (Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective)", "(Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester) or (Oliver Walker created Liam 77)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester)", "(Oliver Walker created Liam 77)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective) or (Oliver Walker created Spectra (TV series))?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective)", "(Oliver Walker created Spectra (TV series))"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester) or (Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester)", "(Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker died in Eastwood) or (Oliver Walker created Liam 77)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker died in Eastwood)", "(Oliver Walker created Liam 77)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Spectra (TV series)) or (Oliver Walker created Liam 77)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Spectra (TV series))", "(Oliver Walker created Liam 77)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester) or (Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester)", "(Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective) or (Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers)?", "C": ["(Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective)", "(Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver Walker died in Eastwood), (Oliver Walker was born in Riverside, Manchester), (Oliver Walker created Liam 77), (Oliver Walker created Blackburn Bombers), (Oliver Walker created Samuel Holmes, Detective).

the only child of a hardworking couple. From a young age, Emily displayed intelligence and grace, capturing the hearts of those around her. As she grew older, she longed for companionship and love.\n\nIn 1924, Emily's dreams blossomed into reality when she married Daniel Thompson, a charming and ambitious man who swept her off her feet. They embarked on a life together, filled with happiness and adventure. However, their love story was short-lived, as tragedy struck and Daniel passed away in 1929.\n\nHeartbroken and grieving, Emily found solace with Oliver James, a kind and nurturing soul who understood her sorrow. They got married later that same year, finding comfort in one another's arms. For over a decade, they created a loving and supportive partnership, sharing countless memories and building a life together.\n\nBut life is unpredictable, and just as Emily had experienced before, Oliver's time came to an end in 1964. He breathed his last breath in Oakland, Florida, leaving Emily to face yet another painful loss. However, she refused to let grief define her spirit.\n\nEmily's strength and resilience carried her through the years, and she focused on honoring the memories of both her late husbands. She channeled her energy into philanthropic pursuits and dedicated her time and resources to causes close to her heart. Emily's selflessness and generosity touched the lives of many, spreading love and happiness wherever she went.\n\nAs life went on, Emily found comfort in reminiscing about the beautiful moments she shared with both Daniel and Oliver. She cherished the memories of their love, carrying them in her heart until her last days.\n\nIn 1982, Emily Johnson, a woman who had experienced both immense joy and profound loss, peacefully passed away in Oceanview. Her legacy as an inspiring and compassionate woman lived on, reminding everyone who knew her of the power of love and resilience.\n\nAnd so, the story of Emily Johnson, born in Denver, unfolded. A story of love, loss, and the unwavering strength of the human spirit that continues to inspire generations to come.", "TG": "(Emily Johnson was born in Denver) starts at 1906\n(Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson) starts at 1924\n(Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James) starts at 1929\n(Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson) starts at 1929\n(Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson) ends at 1929\n(Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida) starts at 1964\n(Oliver James was married to Emily Johnson) ends at 1964\n(Emily Johnson died in Oceanview) starts at 1982\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson died in Oceanview) or (Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson died in Oceanview)", "(Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James) or (Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James) or (Emily Johnson died in Oceanview)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James)", "(Emily Johnson died in Oceanview)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson died in Oceanview) or (Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson died in Oceanview)", "(Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida) or (Emily Johnson was born in Denver)?", "C": ["(Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)", "(Emily Johnson was born in Denver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson died in Oceanview) or (Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson died in Oceanview)", "(Emily Johnson was married to Daniel Thompson)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James) or (Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James)", "(Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James) or (Emily Johnson was born in Denver)?", "C": ["(Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James)", "(Emily Johnson was born in Denver)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson) or (Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)?", "C": ["(Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson)", "(Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Oliver James died in Oakland, Florida), (Emily Johnson was born in Denver), (Emily Johnson died in Oceanview), (Daniel Thompson was married to Emily Johnson), (Emily Johnson was married to Oliver James).

Growing up in this close-knit community, he thrived on the love and support of his family and friends. Little did he know that his life would intertwine with others in unexpected ways.\n\nA year after Michael's birth, Scott Smith entered the world in Greenwood as well. These two boys, unknowingly destined to cross paths, grew up together, forging a bond that would endure for decades to come.\n\nMeanwhile, in the neighboring town of Springfield, a girl named Emma Parker was born in 1942. Throughout her childhood, she displayed a natural talent for the arts, having a special affinity for theater. Her dreams of pursuing a career in the spotlight were nurtured by her loving parents.\n\nFast forward to 1968, when fate began to unfold its mysterious design. Scott and Olivia Harrison, a woman born in Quinton Town, New York in 1945, tied the knot and embarked on a journey together as husband and wife. Their love story seemed to be written in the stars, and for a little while, life was filled with joy and laughter.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Johnson had also found his soulmate. In 1973, he married the talented Emma Parker, whose passion for theater resonated with his own artistic spirit. They became a dynamic duo, supporting each other's dreams and aspirations.\n\nHowever, the path of true love is not always smooth. Tragedy struck in 1980 when Scott Smith tragically passed away in Oceanview. This heartbreaking loss brought an end to his marriage with Olivia Harrison, leaving her grieving and searching for solace.\n\nIn the midst of sorrow and healing, the unexpected happened. In 1991, Michael Johnson's immense talent was recognized, and he was honored with the prestigious Winslow Award for Theatre. This recognition not only validated his dedication to the arts but also served as a turning point in his life.\n\nIn the following years, Olivia Harrison and Michael Johnson found comfort and companionship in each other. In 1999, they decided to start a new chapter in their lives together, bound by love and a shared understanding of loss and resilience.\n\nAlthough their journey had been filled with twists and turns, the story of Michael, Olivia, Scott, and Emma ultimately teaches us the profound impact of love and the enduring power of human connections. These four souls, brought together by fate and life's unpredictable circumstances, proved that even amidst tragedy, hope and happiness can emerge.\n\nAnd so, their intertwined lives continued, forever bound by the threads of love, friendship, and the ever-present reminder that life's greatest joys often emerge from the most unexpected places.", "TG": "(Michael Johnson was born in Greenwood) starts at 1927\n(Emma Parker was born in Springfield) starts at 1942\n(Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York) starts at 1945\n(Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison) starts at 1968\n(Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith) starts at 1968\n(Emma Parker was married to Michael Johnson) starts at 1973\n(Michael Johnson was married to Emma Parker) starts at 1973\n(Scott Smith died in Oceanview) starts at 1980\n(Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith) ends at 1980\n(Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison) ends at 1980\n(Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre) starts at 1991\n(Michael Johnson was married to Olivia Harrison) starts at 1999\n(Olivia Harrison was married to Michael Johnson) starts at 1999\n", "QA": {"Q0": [{"Q": "Which event started first, (Scott Smith died in Oceanview) or (Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison)?", "C": ["(Scott Smith died in Oceanview)", "(Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Michael Johnson was married to Emma Parker) or (Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre)?", "C": ["(Michael Johnson was married to Emma Parker)", "(Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith) or (Olivia Harrison was married to Michael Johnson)?", "C": ["(Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith)", "(Olivia Harrison was married to Michael Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Parker was born in Springfield) or (Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)?", "C": ["(Emma Parker was born in Springfield)", "(Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith) or (Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)?", "C": ["(Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith)", "(Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Parker was born in Springfield) or (Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison)?", "C": ["(Emma Parker was born in Springfield)", "(Scott Smith was married to Olivia Harrison)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Emma Parker was married to Michael Johnson) or (Olivia Harrison was married to Michael Johnson)?", "C": ["(Emma Parker was married to Michael Johnson)", "(Olivia Harrison was married to Michael Johnson)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith) or (Emma Parker was born in Springfield)?", "C": ["(Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith)", "(Emma Parker was born in Springfield)"], "A": ["False", "True"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York) or (Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre)?", "C": ["(Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)", "(Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}, {"Q": "Which event started first, (Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York) or (Michael Johnson was married to Olivia Harrison)?", "C": ["(Olivia Harrison was born in Quinton Town, New York)", "(Michael Johnson was married to Olivia Harrison)"], "A": ["True", "False"]}], "Q1": [{"Q": "Given the following five events: (Michael Johnson won prize Winslow Award for Theatre), (Olivia Harrison was married to Scott Smith), (Michael Johnson was born in Greenwood), (Michael Johnson was married to Emma Parker), (Michael Johnson was married to Olivia Harrison).

He grew up in a loving family, filled with warmth and laughter. Four years later, in the coastal town of Oceanview, Charlotte Thompson was born. She was a sweet and curious girl, always exploring the wonders of the sea and dreaming of adventures.\n\nAs time went on, their paths intertwined. In 1976, Jason and Charlotte found themselves falling deeply in love. Their bond was undeniable, and they decided to embark on the journey of marriage. The wedding was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter, dancing, and promises of a lifetime together.\n\nTheir love story continued to flourish, filling their days with shared dreams and cherished moments. However, fate had different plans in store for them. In 1979, the winds of change brought uncertainty into their lives. It was with heavy hearts that Jason and Charlotte made the difficult decision to part ways. Their marriage ended, but their memories and love stayed within their hearts.\n\nYears passed, and life moved on. In 1989, destiny once again intervened in their lives. Emily Thompson, the dear sister of Charlotte, entered the picture. She was a kind and compassionate woman, with a heart full of love to give. Jason and Emily found solace and understanding in each other's company, and soon their friendship blossomed into something deeper.
